# Task Setup and Requirements

This page describes the requirements for participating on the tasks. Here you will find links and guides to setup your environment properly.

## Supported Architectures

The tooling currently supports the Intel compatible x86_64 architecture. ARM is not currently supported, but there are plans for it to be supported in the future.

## Supported Environments

The following operating systems are officially supported. Other operating systems may also be compatible, but have not officially been tested for compability by our teams.

- [Ubuntu Linux 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/) (Desktop or Server edition)
- [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) (Big Sur 11.0+)
- [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) + [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (Ubuntu 20.04 virtualized)

> Note: Throughout most of our demos and walkthroughs, Ubuntu Linux 20.04 is used. This is the preferred platform.

## Prerequisite Development Software

- Build Tools
- Curl
- 7zip (optional)
- Git
- Node.js 14.17.x (LTS)
- Python 2.7.x
- Yarn
- Docker

## Prerequisite Wallet Software

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html)

## Setup Instructions

### Ubuntu 20.04 (Native or Windows 10 + WSL2)

#### Build Tools + Git + Curl + 7zip

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential git curl p7zip-full
```

#### Node.js

The default version of Node.js included with Ubuntu 20.04 is v10.19.0, and this is not sufficient.

**For these tasks version 14.17.x is needed. Version 16.x.x will not work.** This can be installed using NVM (Node Version Manager), or the normal Node.js installation instructions. We generally recommend using NVM because it allows you to quickly change between any version of Node.js.

- [NVM Install](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- [Node.js Install](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#debinstall)

#### Python 2.7.x

Ubuntu 20.04 ships with Python 3.8.x installed, but Python 2.7.x is still available for compatibility with old tooling using the `python` package.

```sh
sudo apt install python
```

#### Yarn

Yarn can easily be installed using NPM once Node.js is installed.

```sh
npm i -g yarn
```

#### Docker

Docker will be used for running Solidity compiler to compile smart contracts. You can find informations how to install it on official [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you're using Windows + Windows Subsystem For Linux it will be the easiest if you download and install official "Docker for Windows" desktop application. It makes using Docker easy thanks to graphical interface.

### MacOS (10.13+)

#### Build Tools + Git

Download and install the Xcode Command Line Tools from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/).

#### Curl

Curl should be installed by default on recent versions of MacOS.

#### 7zip

There are several decompressors available for MacOS that can handle 7z files, but we recommend `p7zip` since it will be fully compatible with our scripts. This can be installed using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/p7zip).

#### Node.js

Node.js can be installed on MacOS using NVM, or by using the Node.js installer. **For these tasks version 14.17.x is needed. Version 16.x.x will not work.**

- [NVM Install](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- [Node.js Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Python 2.7.x

To install Python 2.7.x on MacOS, please visit the official Python [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/) page.

#### Yarn

Yarn can easily be installed using NPM once Node.js is installed.

```sh
npm i -g yarn
```

#### Docker

Docker will be used for running Solidity compiler to compile smart contracts. You can find informations how to install it on official [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Checking Your Node.js and Yarn Versions

One of the most common causes of errors are problems with the Node.js and Yarn versions. These Gitcoin tasks specifically require Node.js v14.17.x, and a recent version of Yarn. You can check these versions using the commands below.

```txt
node -v
v14.17.3
yarn -v
1.22.11
```
