## Mainnet / Testnet / Devnet

Nervos officially supports three different types of networks.

The Mainnet, also known as "Lina", is the live production network. This public network is fully decentralized and permissionless, and relies on a robust Proof of Work (PoW) based incentive system to protect all of the assets on the network.

The Testnet, also known as "Aggron", is the public sandbox network. The software used by this network is exactly the same as the Mainnet, but all tokens and assets on the Testnet have no value. This environment provides a safe place for developers to experiment in a realistic shared environment with other developers, without the associated cost or risk.

New features are always tested on the Testnet prior to release on the Mainnet. For this reason, the Testnet may occasionally not have 100% reliability. The Testnet also uses Proof of Work, but because none of the tokens have value, there is only a minimal amount of security provided. Due to the nature of a Testnet, all data there should be viewed as imperminant.

A Devnet is a private network for testing purposes. It is similar to the Aggron Testnet, except that it is not a shared environment. Devnets normally reside entirely on the developer's computer, and are created on-demand as they are needed by the developer. Multiple Devnets can be created as needed, and they can each have slightly different configurations, and be paused or deleted as needed.

When a developer begins working on a new dapp, using a Devnet is recommended place to begin. A new network can be created instantly, without having to wait for the network to synchronize. A Devnet uses simulated mining, meaning it is centralized, but extremely efficient and low power to operate.
