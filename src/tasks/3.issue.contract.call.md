# 3. Issue a smart contract call to the deployed smart contract

> Note: Before you complete the tasks, be sure to review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

## 1. [Create an address on Layer 1, add some CKBytes from Testnet Faucet, and export the private key.](../component-tutorials/10.setup.account.cli.md)
## 2. [Create a Godwoken account by making a deposit to Layer 2 using your private key.](../component-tutorials/11.layer2.deposit.md)

Prepare the private key of your **Ethereum** address. You will need it in next step to deploy a smart-contract. Make sure this is Ethereum private key (Layer 2 private key), not a Layer 1 private key. If you use Layer 1 private key it won't work.

## 3. Clone and setup the examples repository

In this step you have to clone the examples repository. It contains code setup for easy smart-contract compilation and deploy. It's using originval version of Web3.js and Truffle. The only difference is that it's using custom Web3.js provider.

Execute following commands (clone repository and install dependencies):

```
git clone https://github.com/kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction
cd gw-gitcoin-instruction/src/3-call-contract
yarn
```

## 4. Prepare smart-contract address and ABI

To call a smart-contract it needs to be deployed. Then you need to have its address and ABI. ABI is Application Binary Interface. It is used (among other things) as "decription" of what methods can be called on a smart-contract. ABI is a result of compilation of smart-contract. For popular smart-contracts its also usually accessible by a quick web search or can be obtained from Etherscan for the Ethereum smart-contracts.

If you don't have existing smart-contract address and ABI then deploy your own smart-contract. It's a straightforward process, trust us. There is complete tutorial how to do it in ["Deploy a simple Ethereum smart contract on Polyjuice"](./2.deploy.eth.contract.md) task tutorial. If you've used default SimpleStorage.sol contract then you should find ABI in `2-deploy-contract/build/contracts/SimpleStorage.json`. It is under "abi" property in the JSON. For the previously mentioned smart-contract ABI is:
```JSON
[
    {
      "inputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "payable",
      "type": "constructor"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "x",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "name": "set",
      "outputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "payable",
      "type": "function"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [],
      "name": "get",
      "outputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "stateMutability": "view",
      "type": "function"
    }
]
```

If you haven't deployed your own smart-contract then example deployed SimpleStorage address you can use on testnet is:
```
0xC46e27169824290EcaEf6E14503C1a6DE72d41B0
```

## 5. Prepare and run a script to call smart-contract

### Private key

The example script that you're going to run already exists in `examples/3-call-contract/index.js`. First, change the Ethereum private key used to call smart-contract in this file. Put there your Ethereum private key to the Ethereum account that you've deposited funds from Layer 1 to. Name of the variable to change is: `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`. Make sure you put there your Ethereum private key, not your CKB private key.

### ABI

Put ABI as value of the following variable:
```js
const CONTRACT_ABI = '<YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI>';
```

### Contract address

Put contract address as value of the following variable:
```js
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '<YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
```

### Run script

When you've replaced all the variables above you're ready to call the script. Run following commands:
```
cd /src/examples/3-call-contract
yarn
node index.js
```
