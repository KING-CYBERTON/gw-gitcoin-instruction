# 4. Issue an SUDT Token on Layer 1 and Deposit it into Polyjuice on Layer 2

In this task, we create a token on Layer 1, then move it to the EVM compatible Layer 2. The token on Layer 1 will use the SUDT standard, which is the most basic form of asset on Nervos. When the token is moved to Layer 2, it is exchanged for an ERC20 token, which is the most popular token standard on blockchains that support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The reason that ERC20 tokens are used on Layer 2 is that this ensures full compatibility with EVM. Existing smart contracts that are designed for Ethereum, using languages like Solidity, will continue to work without modification. Because the EVM Layer 2 is based on optimistic rollups, any dapp built on it will immediately gain higher TPS with dramatically lower fees for all their users.

In the future, support for other blockchains, such as Cardano, Polkadot, and Stellar, can be added. This enables Nervos to support smart contracts from virtually any platform, and all of their respective token standards. All tokens based on any standard will be able to freely move between layers, and different environments, enabling asset transfer functionality that was previously difficult to impossible on many other platforms.

## Requirements

Before starting, you will need to setup your development environment. For information about setup and requirements please [review this article](../tasks-setup-and-requirements/tasks-setup-and-requirements.md).

## Task Instructions

We will start by issuing an SUDT token on Layer 1. To do this, you will need the private key of a Layer 1 account that has been funded with Testnet CKBytes. You should already have this available from the previous tasks. After you have a funded account, you can use the `sudt-cli` tool to create an SUDT token on the Layer 1 Testnet.

> Note: Your private keys are used to secure your accounts and all the funds and assets contained within. It is important to keep your private keys safe, and to only use them with tools you can trust. However, on these tasks we will only be working with Testnet funds and assets that have no value. You can operate without concern knowing that there is nothing at risk.

### 1. Setup a Layer 1 Account With Funds

The first step is to setup an account with Testnet funds. You may still have some from the previous tasks. If not, you can complete the steps in this [tutorial](../component-tutorials/10.setup.account.cli.md) to do so.

After your account is setup and funded, keep track of your private key and corresponding Testnet address. You will be able to use these with the [sudt-cli](../conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#sudt-cli) tool to issue a token on Nervos' Layer 1!

### 2. Use the `sudt-cli` Tool to Issue an SUDT Token on Layer 1

The next step is to create an SUDT token on Nervos' Layer 1. This can be done using the `sudt-cli` command line tool. This tool with use your private key to access the funds on the corresponding account to create the SUDT tokens.

A tutorial on how to use the `sudt-cli` tool can be found [here](../component-tutorials/9.issue.sudt.cli.md).

### 3. Configure the Deposit Tool to Use a Testnet CKB Node

The Deposit Tool will require access to a CKB Node that is configured for the Testnet. You can either set one up locally using [these instructions](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/testnet), or you can use an existing public Testnet node. We provide the parameters to use the existing public node in the next step.

If you're running a local Testnet node, it will take 4-5 hours to synchronize, but you can optionally use a [bootstrap](https://ckb.tools/bootstrap) to speed up this process.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/godwoken-examples -b testnet-script
cd godwoken-examples
yarn && yarn run build-all
yarn run generate-testnet-configs
```

### 4. Deposit Layer 1 SUDT Tokens to on Layer 2 to Create a Godwoken Account

To deposit your SUDT tokens to Layer 2, you will need to execute the following command in `godwoken-examples` directory. Replace the `<VARIABLES>` in the command template below with the values matching your account and node information.

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit-sudt -m 20 -s <INSERT_TOKEN_SCRIPT_ARGS> -p <INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY> -l <INSERT_ETH_ADDRESS> -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -d <INSERT_TESTNET_INDEXER_URL>
```

Variable Description:

1. `<INSERT_TOKEN_SCRIPT_ARGS>` - This is the **SUDT Type Args** value from SUDT-CLI tool, which is visible after you issue tokens or check the balance. If you're unsure how to get it please revisit the [Issue SUDT using command-line interface](/src/component-tutorials/9.issue.sudt.cli.md) tutorial.
2. `<INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY>` - This is the private key to your account. The instructions how to get it are in [step 1](#1-setup-a-layer-1-account-with-funds) of this tutorial.
3. `<INSERT_ETH_ADDRESS>` - The Ethereum address of your account from MetaMask. This will be used to receive funds on Layer 2. This can be found in MetaMask by clicking the address within the wallet as seen below.

<img src="../images/metamask-address.png" style="border: 1px solid #eeeeee; height: 300px" />

4. `<INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet CKB node you will use.You can [setup your own local Testnet node](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/testnet), or you can use any public node.

- Nervos Foundation Public Testnet CKB Node: `http://3.235.223.161:18114`

5. `<INSERT_TESTNET_INDEXER_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet CKB Indexer you will use. You can [setup your own local Indexer node](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer/), or you can use any public indexer.

- Nervos Foundation Public Testnet CKB Indexer: `http://3.235.223.161:18116`

Example final command with all variables filled in:

``` sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit-sudt -m 20 -s 0x5c7253696786b9eddd34e4f6b6e478ec5742bd36569ec60c1d0487480ba4f9e3 -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -l 0xD173313A51f8fc37BcF67569b463abd89d81844f -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -d http://3.235.223.161:18116
```

> Note: The Deposit Tool will need to sync with Testnet on the first usage. This can sometimes take several hours, but there are ways to speed this up. Look at the instructions below to see how this can be done.

### How to Speed Up the Deposit Tool Sync Process

The Deposit Tool uses a built in CKB Indexer, which needs to fully synchronize with a Testnet CKB Indexer before it can create transactions. This process can be sped up dramatically by using checkpoint data.

To use this, stop the Deposit Tool using `ctrl+c`, then run the following commands to download the checkpoint data to the appropriate location.

```sh
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
cd godwoken-examples
chmod +x get-testnet-checkpoint-data.sh
./get-testnet-checkpoint-data.sh
```

After this process is successful, start the Deposit Tool again using the same command that was used previously. The sync process should now start much higher (usually 90% or more), and the remaining sync will take much less time.

#### Potential Errors and Solutions

- If you get the error: `"Not enough capacity in from infos!"` then it means your account on Layer 1 (that you passed access to via private key) doesn't have enough funds to perform an operation.
- If you get the error: `"Not enough amount in from infos!"` then it means you either didn't issue tokens on Layer 1 before running this command, or you've issued less than you want to deposit to Layer 2 now.
