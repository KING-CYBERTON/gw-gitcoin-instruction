# Setup a Local CKB Node and CKB Indexer for the Testnet

Before diving into the more complicated tasks, you need to setup a [CKB Node](../conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#ckb-node) and a [CKB Indexer](../conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#ckb-indexer). These two pieces of node software work together to support the needs of dApps. The scripts we will use later on will interact with the Nervos Testnet and rely on these nodes for information about the state of the network.

You can run nodes locally, or you can use public nodes. The Nervos Foundation hosts public Testnet nodes for use with the Gitcoin tasks, and you will find their URLs at the bottom of this page. However, **running a local node is highly recommended** since synchronization with the public nodes is a much slower process that using one locally.

When setting up a node, you are given the option of using the [Mainnet](../conceptual-explainers/structure.md#mainnet--testnet--devnet), the [Testnet](../conceptual-explainers/structure.md#mainnet--testnet--devnet), or a [Devnet](../conceptual-explainers/structure.md#mainnet--testnet--devnet). We will be using the Testnet since this is the test environment that will require the least amount of setup.

The Nervos Testnet, also known as "Aggron", is the public facing test environment for Nervos Network. This is a shared test environment which contains the new infrastructure that is not yet available on the Mainnet. The tokens and assets on the Testnet have no value, so you can safely test here without worrying about any lost funds.

## Task Instructions

> Note: Before you complete the tasks, be sure to review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

In this task you will setup a local CKB Node and a local CKB Indexer for use with the Aggron Testnet. The general process is as follows:

1. Setup a local CKB Node, configure it for the Testnet, and allow it to fully synchronize with the network.
2. Setup a local CKB Indexer, and allow it to fully synchronize with the local CKB Node.

### CKB Node

To setup a Testnet CKB Node, follow the steps in [this guide](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/testnet). Once the node has started, it will take 5+ hours to fully synchronize with the network, but you can speed up the process by using a [Bootstrap](https://ckb.tools/bootstrap) from [CKB.tools](../conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#ckbtools).

### CKB Indexer

To setup a Testnet CKB Indexer, follow the steps below. Once the node has started, it will take several hours to fully synchronize with the CKB Node, but you can speed up the process by using a [Bootstrap](https://ckb.tools/bootstrap) from CKB.tools.

First, download a binary from the [CKB Indexer Releases page](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer/releases).

```sh
https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer/releases/download/v0.2.1/ckb-indexer-0.2.1-linux.zip
```

Then, decompress archive in the `ckb-indexer` directory.

```sh
mkdir ckb-indexer
cd ckb-indexer
unzip ../ckb-indexer-0.2.1-linux.zip
tar xzf ckb-indexer-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
chmod 755 ckb-indexer
```

Then start the indexer.

```sh
RUST_LOG=info ./ckb-indexer -s ./indexer-data
```

> Note: The CKB Indexer requires the CKB Node to be running before it can begin synchronizing. If you have not setup a CKB Node, please do that first.

## Local Testnet Node URLs

Once your local Testnet nodes are running and synchronized, they can be accessed using the following URLs:

- Local CKB Node RPC URL: `http://localhost:8114`
- Local CKB Indexer RPC URL: `http://localhost:8116`

## Public Testnet Node URLs

The Nervos Foundation hosts public nodes for the Testnet, which are available for use with the Gitcoin tasks. However, **running a local node is highly recommended** since synchronization with the public nodes is a much slower process that using one locally.

- CKB Node RPC URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18114`
- CKB Indexer RPC URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18116`

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A screenshot of the console output from the Testnet CKB Node after it has fully synchronized with the network.
2. A screenshot of the console output from the CKB Indexer after it has fully synchronized with the local Testnet CKB Node.
