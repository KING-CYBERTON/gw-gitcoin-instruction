# Complete Withdrawal Process by Unlocking the Funds

Withdrawal in Godwoken is a two step process. The first part is initializing withdraw, and second is unlocking the funds. Funds can be unlocked only after five day challenge period has passed. This time gives Layer 2 network operators a time to check and challenge the malicious transactions.

> Note 1: An Optimistic Rollup security assumption is that there is at least one honest node in the network.

> Note 2: It is possible that in future there will exist other solutions allowing for faster exits.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will use Godwoken Examples Tools Package repository to run the "unlock" command. It will complete withdrawal process from Nervos' Layer 2. Remember you can only unlock funds that you've initiated withdrawal of previously.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [initiate withdrawal task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/9.withdraw.md) and wait five days.

### 1. Execute "unlock" command

Assuming you have met the prerequisites and created the account, you will have to execute "unlock" command using Godwoken Examples Tools Package.

```
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js unlock -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -p <YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

Example final command with all the variables filled in:

```sh
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js unlock -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18
```

[ERROR]: No valid withdrawal cell found
```

</details>

If you see "No valid withdrawal cell found" message it can mean two things:
1. The withdrawal hasn't been initiated.
2. You didn't wait five days after initiating withdrawal.

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A screenshot of the console output immediately after running the "unlock" command.
2. The Ethereum address that you've used for your Layer 2 account.
3. The Nervos Layer 1 address associated with the private key passed to "unlock" command. It can be found as "ckb address" in console output.
