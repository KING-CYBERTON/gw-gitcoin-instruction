# 10. Complete Withdrawal Process by Unlocking the Funds

A withdrawal in Godwoken is a two step process. The first part is initializing the withdraw, and second is unlocking the funds. After the withdrawal is initiated, a five day challenge period begins. This is a period where Layer 2 network operators have time to check and raise issues with any potentially malicious transactions and rollback if necessary.

In the [previous task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/9.withdraw.md), you initated the withdrawal. In this task you will complete the process by issuing the `unlock` command.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will use Godwoken Examples tool package repository to run the "unlock" command. This will complete withdrawal process from Nervos' Layer 2. Remember, you can only unlock funds that you've initiated withdrawal of previously.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [withdrawal task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/9.withdraw.md) and wait five days.

You can find setup instructions for Godwoken Examples tool package [here](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/component-tutorials/3.setup.and.use.account.cli.md#setup-the-godwoken-examples-tools-package).

### 1. Execute the Unlock Command

Using the Godwoken Examples tool package, execute the `unlock` command using the command below, replacing values as needed.

```sh
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js unlock -p <YOUR_LAYER_1_PRIVATE_KEY> -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -i <INSERT_TESTNET_INDEXER_URL>
```

> Note: The private key you pass to `unlock` command needs to be the same as the one that corresponds with the Layer 1 address that was previously used with the `withdraw` and `deposit`.

1. `<YOUR_LAYER_1_PRIVATE_KEY>` - This is the private key for the Layer 1 account where the funds will be unlocked and released to. **Always make sure your private key is prefixed with "0x".**
2. `<INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet CKB node you will use. This should be your local address if you are using a local node, or it can be a public address if you're using a public node.\
Local Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8114`\
Public Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18114`
3. `<INSERT_INDEXER_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet [ckb-indexer](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-indexer) you will use. This should be your local address if you are using a local indexer, or it can be a public address if you're using a public indexer.\
Local Testnet ckb-indexer URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8116`\
Public Testnet ckb-indexer URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18116`


Example final command with all the values filled in:

```sh
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js unlock -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -i http://3.235.223.161:18116
```

</details>

If you see message about transaction being committed, then congratulations! You've successfully withdrawn funds from Nervos' Layer 2. 👏 They exist now on Nervos' Layer 1 where they be used with layer 1 dApps, or be moved to another blockchain using [Force Bridge](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/conceptual-explainers/infrastructure.md#force-bridge).

### Potential Errors

If you see `[INFO]: withdrawal cell not finalized` it means that the five day challenge period has not been completed. You can see how many blocks you still need to wait by comparing "last_finalized_block_number" with "withdrawal_block_number". The first needs to be higher than the latter. You should see both of these values in the console output. For example:

```txt
withdrawal_block_number 1210n { last_finalized_block_number: 1197n }
```

If you see `[ERROR]: No valid withdrawal cell found` message it means that you haven't properly initialized the withdrawal using the `withdraw` command from the [previous task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/9.withdraw.md). If you did run withdraw command, make sure that the correct Layer 1 address has been passed to it.

If you see `TransactionFailedToResolve: Resolve failed Dead(OutPoint...` then please try executing the command again. This can be the result of pending transactions which have recently completed. If you continue to receive this command, try waiting a few minutes before issuing the command again.

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, add the following materials to a document on your Github and submit for review by the judges (include the link in your Gitcoin submission):

1. A screenshot of the console output immediately after running the "unlock" command.
2. The Ethereum address that you've used for your Layer 2 account (in text format).
3. The Nervos Layer 1 address associated with the private key passed to "unlock" command (in text format). This is "ckb address" in the console output.

> Note: You must wait the full five day challenge period in order to complete this task. If you submit screenshots of an incomplete withdrawal, your submission will be rejected by the judges.
