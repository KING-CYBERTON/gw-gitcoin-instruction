# 11. Use a Tron Wallet to Execute a Smart Contract Call

<hr>

# WORK IN PROGRESS [ðŸš§]

What if you could deploy Ethereum smart contract and call it using Tron wallet? Well, in Nervos: Yes, you can!

In this tutorial you will install Tron wallet, fund it on Nervos' Layer 2 and call previously deployed smart contract.

## Task Instructions

> Note: Before starting the tasks, it is recommended that you review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

In this task you'll create a Tron Godwoken account on Nervos' EVM Layer 2 [Testnet](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/structure.md#mainnet--testnet--devnet). Later you'll use it to do a smart contract call.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must deploy smart contract first to Nervos' Layer 2. You can find instructions how to do it in [previous task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/tasks/2.deploy.eth.contract.md). If you have not completed it, please do so now. The address of this smart contract will be needed in this task.

Additionally you will need to setup Godwoken Examples Tools. You can find setup instructions for Godwoken Examples Tools Package [here](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/component-tutorials/3.setup.and.use.account.cli.md#setup-the-godwoken-examples-tools-package).

### 1. Create and Fund an Account with CKBytes on Layer 1

In this first step you must create an account on the Testnet Nervos CKB Layer 1 blockchain, fund it with some CKBytes, then export the private key for the account so it can be provided to other scripts.

This can be accomplished easily using the [ckb-cli](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#ckb-cli) command line tool that is included with the [CKB Node](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#ckb-node) software. Free Testnet CKBytes can be obtained by using the [Nervos Faucet](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/infrastructure.md#nervos-faucet).

For instructions on completing this step, please follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/component-tutorials/1.setup.account.in.ckb.cli.md).

### 2. Setup Tron account

In this step you need to install Tron wallet and create an account. Follow [this tutorial](../component-tutorials/8.setup.tron.md).


### 3. Deposit some CKBytes on Layer 2

In this step you must make a deposit of CKBytes from Layer 1 to the Layer 2 which is provided by Godwoken. This step is necessary for Godwoken to create the user's Layer 2 account.

On Nervos, the user is responsible for paying state rent for any on-chain data they use, and this is done by requiring the user to lock 1 CKByte for every byte of data that needs to be stored on-chain. This is different from Ethereum, where state rent is still in the planning phases and has not been implemented yet. This deposit is used by Godwoken to lock CKBytes to pay the required state rent. For a more detail explanation about the tokenomics of Nervos, we recommended you view the [Crypto-Economics Whitepaper](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics.md).

This deposit can be made using the example script code provided in the tutorial below. Make sure you have your private key from the previous step available since it will be needed by the example script.

For instructions on completing this step using Tron wallet, please follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/component-tutorials/9.layer2.deposit.tron.md).

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A screenshot of the accounts you created (`account list`) in `ckb-cli`.
2. A link to the Layer 1 address you funded on the [Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.nervos.org/aggron/).
3. A screenshot of the console output immediately after you have successfully submitted a deposit to Layer 2.
