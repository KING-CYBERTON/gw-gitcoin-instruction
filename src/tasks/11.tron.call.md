# 11. Use a Tron Wallet to Execute a Smart Contract Call

What if you could deploy Ethereum smart contract and call it using Tron wallet? Well, in Nervos: Yes, you can!

In this tutorial you will install Tron wallet, fund it on Nervos' Layer 2 and call previously deployed smart contract. This code will allow you to interact with your smart contract which is running on Nervos' [Layer 2](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2) in a nearly identical way to if it was running on Ethereum.

## Task Instructions

> Note: Before starting the tasks, it is recommended that you review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

In this task you'll create a Tron Godwoken account on Nervos' EVM Layer 2 [Testnet](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/structure.md#mainnet--testnet--devnet). Later you'll use it to do a smart contract call.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must deploy smart contract first to Nervos' Layer 2. You can find instructions how to do it in [previous task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/tasks/2.deploy.eth.contract.md). If you have not completed it, please do so now. The address of this smart contract will be needed in this task.

Additionally you will need to setup Godwoken Examples Tools. You can find setup instructions for Godwoken Examples Tools Package [here](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/component-tutorials/3.setup.and.use.account.cli.md#setup-the-godwoken-examples-tools-package).

### 1. Create and Fund an Account with CKBytes on Layer 1

In this first step you must create an account on the Testnet Nervos CKB Layer 1 blockchain, fund it with some CKBytes, then export the private key for the account so it can be provided to other scripts.

This can be accomplished easily using the [ckb-cli](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#ckb-cli) command line tool that is included with the [CKB Node](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#ckb-node) software. Free Testnet CKBytes can be obtained by using the [Nervos Faucet](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/infrastructure.md#nervos-faucet).

For instructions on completing this step, please follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/component-tutorials/1.setup.account.in.ckb.cli.md).

### 2. Setup Tron account

In this step you need to install Tron wallet and create an account. Follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/component-tutorials/8.setup.tron.md). It contains details information how to setup a Tron account.


### 3. Deposit some CKBytes on Layer 2

In this step you must make a deposit of CKBytes from Layer 1 to the Layer 2 which is provided by Godwoken. This step is necessary for Godwoken to create the user's Layer 2 account.

On Nervos, the user is responsible for paying state rent for any on-chain data they use, and this is done by requiring the user to lock 1 CKByte for every byte of data that needs to be stored on-chain. This is different from Ethereum, where state rent is still in the planning phases and has not been implemented yet. This deposit is used by Godwoken to lock CKBytes to pay the required state rent. For a more detail explanation about the tokenomics of Nervos, we recommended you view the [Crypto-Economics Whitepaper](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics.md).

This deposit can be made using the example script code provided in the tutorial below. Make sure you have your private key from the previous step available since it will be needed by the example script.

For instructions on completing this step using Tron wallet, please follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/component-tutorials/9.layer2.deposit.tron.md).

### 4. Prepare the Smart Contract Address and ABI

In order to execute a function call on a smart contract, it must be deployed, and you must have the ABI that was generated when the code was originally compiled. "ABI" stands for Application Binary Interface, and it contains the information required by an application to interface and call functions on the smart contract.

In the [previous task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/2.deploy.eth.contract.md), you compiled and deployed an Ethereum smart contract. You may be able to reuse that smart contract for this task. If it is no longer available, please revisit the [previous task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/2.deploy.eth.contract.md) and complete it again.

The example smart contract from the previous task is `SimpleStorage.sol`, and the corresponding ABI value can be found in `2-deploy-contract/build/contracts/SimpleStorage.json` after the contract is compiled. Below is the ABI value which has been extracted from this file.

```json
[
    {
      "inputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "payable",
      "type": "constructor"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "x",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "name": "set",
      "outputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "payable",
      "type": "function"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [],
      "name": "get",
      "outputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "stateMutability": "view",
      "type": "function"
    }
]
```

The SimpleStorage contract has also been deployed to Testnet at the address below. You can optionally use this for testing purposes, but the judges will require you to use your own contract to complete this task.

```

### 5. Prepare and Run the Example Code to Call the Smart Contract

Next we will use the example code to make a function call in your smart contract. Open the file `gw-gitcoin-instruction/src/examples/11-tron/index.mjs` in an editor of your choosing, and find the `readCall()` and `writeCall()` functions.

The function `readCall()` will read a value from the smart contract without a state change. This does not require a transaction because no data is changing. The `writeCall()` function will write a new value to your smart contract. A transaction will be required because state changes can only occur through transactions. This behavior is the same as on the Ethereum chain.

Next, you need to update the values in `index.mjs` to match your private key, Tron address and smart contract.

#### Account address

The first thing you will need to do is update `index.mjs` with your Tron address. You can get Tron address from your Tron wallet. Replace `<YOUR_TRON_ADDRESS>` with this value.

```js
const TRON_ADDRESS = '<YOUR_TRON_ADDRESS>';
```

#### Private Key

The second thing you will need to do is update `index.mjs` with your Tron private key. This private key will be used to make the function calls, and it should be the same Tron private key that funds were added to in the previous step of this tutorial. Make sure you use your **Tron** private key for Layer 2, not your Nervos CKB Layer 1 private key. Replace `<YOUR_TRON_PRIVATE_KEY>` with this value.

```js
const ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY = '<YOUR_TRON_PRIVATE_KEY>';
```

#### ABI

Next, add your contract ABI to the script by replacing `<YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI>` with the ABI value from the JSON file which was generated during compilation.

> Note: The `CONTRACT_ABI` constant is expecting an array with your ABI as index 0. Make sure this is a data structure, just like it is in `SimpleStorage.json`, and does not get input as a string.

```js
const CONTRACT_ABI = [<YOUR_CONTRACT_ABI>]; // Array
```

#### Contract Address

Replace `<YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` with the address of the Ethereum contract you will be making calls to. This value should be a hex string that was returned when the after deploying the contract.

```js
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '<YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>';
```

#### Replace the Read Function Name

Locate `<YOUR_READ_FUNCTION_NAME>` within the `readCall()` function. This must be replaced with function name from your contract that is used for reading.

```js
const callResult = await contract.methods.<YOUR_READ_FUNCTION_NAME>().call();
```

#### Replace the Write Function Name

Locate `<YOUR_WRITE_FUNCTION_NAME>` within the `writeCall()` function. This must be replaced with function name from your contract that is used for writing.

```js
const callData = contract.methods.<YOUR_WRITE_FUNCTION_NAME>().encodeABI();
```

#### Run the Script

After all values have been replaced, use the following commands in a console to execute the script.

```sh
cd ~/projects/gw-gitcoin-instruction/src/examples/11-tron
node index.mjs
```

```

</details>

If you've seen transaction hash and the smart contract state changed then congratulations! You have successfully issued a smart contract write call on Nervos Layer 2.
