# 2. Deploy a simple Ethereum smart contract on polyjuice

> Note: Before you complete the tasks, be sure to review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

## 1. [Create an address on Layer 1, add some CKBytes from Testnet Faucet, and export the private key.](../component-tutorials/10.setup.account.cli.md)
## 2. [Create a Godwoken account by making a deposit to Layer 2 using your private key.](../component-tutorials/11.layer2.deposit.md)

Prepare the private key of your **Ethereum** address. You will need it in next step to deploy a smart-contract. Make sure this is Ethereum private key (Layer 2 private key), not a Layer 1 private key. If you use Layer 1 private key it won't work.

## 3. Clone and setup the examples repository

In this step you have to clone the examples repository. It contains code setup for easy smart-contract compilation and deploy. It's using originval version of Web3.js and Truffle. The only difference is that it's using custom Web3.js provider.

Execute following commands (clone repository and install dependencies):

```
git clone https://github.com/kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction
cd gw-gitcoin-instruction/src/2-deploy-contract
yarn
```

## 4. Compile a smart-contract and copy the artifact

Before you deploy a smart-contract you need to compile it. There are multiple ways to do it. You can use example setup we've put together for you to quickly compile a smart-contract using Truffle and Solidity compiler.

You can use any smart-contract you want for this task. We provide an example one.

The example Solidity smart-contract is in the `src/examples/2-deploy-contract/contracts` directory. Here's the code of `SimpleStorage.sol` smart-contract:

``` solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
  uint storedData;

  constructor() payable {
    storedData = 123;
  }

  function set(uint x) public payable {
    storedData = x;
  }

  function get() public view returns (uint) {
    return storedData;
  }
}
```

If you know Solidity you can modify the contract if you want. After you're done you need to compile the contract before you can deploy it.

**Before running "compile" command make sure that Docker is installed and running! It is necessary for the Solidity compiler.**

Run:

```
yarn compile
```

After the command is complete you should see the compiled file in `build/contracts` directory. For example: `src/examples/2-deploy-contract/build/contracts/SimpleStorage.json`.

> **Alternatively** you can go to http://remix.ethereum.org/, add your Solidity smart-contract and compile it. As a result you will receive a JSON file (you can find it in Remix "artifacts" directory). Place the content of this file in `src/examples/2-deploy-contract/build/contracts` directory.

If `src/examples/2-deploy-contract/build/contracts/SimpleStorage.json` (or other contract name) is ready, either compiled using Truffle or from Remix, you can proceed to the next step.

## 5. Deploy a smart-contract using web3.js

In the [`/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/` directory](/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/) there is everything you need to deploy a smart-contract to Nervos Layer 2. 

First, change the Ethereum private key used to deploy in [/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js](/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js). Put there your Ethereum private key to the Ethereum account that you've deposited funds from Layer 1 to.

Run [/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js](/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js) script via console:

```sh
cd /src/examples/2-deploy-contract
yarn
node index.js SimpleStorage.json
```

## Task Submission

As a result of the previous step you should have received `Transaction hash` and `Deployed contract address` as part of the command output.

To complete the task, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. Deploy transaction hash.
2. Deployed contract address.
3. A screenshot of the console output immediately after you have successfully deployed a smart-contract.
