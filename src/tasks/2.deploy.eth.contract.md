# 2. Deploy a Simple Ethereum Smart Contract on Polyjuice

## Task Instructions

> Note: Before you complete the tasks, be sure to review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

In this task you will take a very basic smart contract written in Ethereum's Solidity, compile it to EVM bytecode, and deploy it to Polyjuice on Layer 2.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [previous task](1.create.godwoken.account.md) to create a Godwoken account on the EVM Layer 2 Testnet. You will need the private key and Testnet address from this previous task in order to proceed. If you have not completed it, please do so now.

### 1. Prepare Your Ethereum Private Key

In the previous task, you extracted the private key for your Nervos CKB Layer 1 account. Next we need to extract the private key for your **Ethereum** account. This private key will be used by the tooling to deploy your smart contract on Layer 2. Attempting to recycle your Layer 1 private key as a Layer 2 private key is not recommended and may cause the process to fail.

> Note: Never use a private key that is associated with a real account for any of these tasks. The following steps will show you how to extract your private key from MetaMask, but you should never do this using a MetaMask installation that you use for real funds since this could potentially leak infomation that could compromise your account.

To extract your private key from MetaMask, follow the instructions in [this tutorial](../component-tutorials/5.extract.ethereum.private.key.md).

## 2. Clone and Setup the Gitcoin Task Instruction Examples

In this step you have to clone the Gitcoin Task Instructions examples repository, which contains the example code required by the tasks. The code we will be working with in this step will compile your smart contract and deploy it. This uses the original versions of Web3.js and Truffle for Ethereum, with only a small difference in that they use a custom Web3.js provider.

Execute following commands to clone the Git repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction
cd gw-gitcoin-instruction/src/examples/2-deploy-contract
yarn
```

## 4. Compile the Smart Contract and Copy the Artifact

Before you deploy a smart-contract you need to compile it. This can be done in several ways. Our instructions will show you how to quickly compile a smart-contract using the Truffle compiler, but if you have an alternate method you prefer this can also be used.

### Using the Truffle Compiler

Provided below is a simple smart contract example that you can use, however you can use any smart contract you wish for this task.

The example Solidity smart contract below is `SimpleStorage.sol`, and it is located in the `src/examples/2-deploy-contract/contracts` directory.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
  uint storedData;

  constructor() payable {
    storedData = 123;
  }

  function set(uint x) public payable {
    storedData = x;
  }

  function get() public view returns (uint) {
    return storedData;
  }
}
```

The command below can be used to compile the Solidity into EVM bytecode using the Truffle compiler. This process will use Docker. If you do not have Docker installed, please revisit the [task setup and requirements](../task-setup-and-requirements/task-setup-and-requirements.md) page.

```sh
yarn compile
```

After the command is complete you will find the compiled file in the `build/contracts` directory. ie: `src/examples/2-deploy-contract/build/contracts/SimpleStorage.json`

### Alternative: Using the Remix Compiler

As an alternative to using to the Truffle compiler, you use the Remix compiler at http://remix.ethereum.org/. If you have already used the Truffle compiler, then you do not need to use Remix.

We will not be providing detailed instructions on using Remix, so this is only recommended if you are already familiar with this tool. After uploading and compiling your Solidity code, you will receive a JSON file that can be found in Remix's "artifacts" directory. Place the contents of this file in `src/examples/2-deploy-contract/build/contracts` directory.

## 5. Deploy a Smart Contract Using Web3.js

In the [`/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/` directory](/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/) you will find everything needed to deploy a smart contract to Nervos Layer 2.

First, update the Ethereum private key in the file [/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js](/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js). Replace the value of the `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` constant with Ethereum private key that you recorded earlier. This should be the private key that corresponds with the Ethereum account that was funded previously.

Run the [/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js](/src/examples/2-deploy-contract/index.js) script via console using the following commands:

```sh
cd /src/examples/2-deploy-contract
yarn
node index.js SimpleStorage.json
```

After running the command, the contract should deploy without any errors. You will be presented with a transaction hash, and an Ethereum contract address. The transaction hash is provided by Godwoken, and Ethereum contract address is provided by Polyjuice. Keep track of these values as they will be needed in the future tasks and for task submission.

Deployed contract address: 0xC46e27169824290EcaEf6E14503C1a6DE72d41B0
```

</details>

## Task Submission

As a result of the contract deployment, you should have received a `Transaction hash` and a `Deployed contract address`.

To complete the task, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A screenshot of the console output immediately after you have successfully deployed a smart-contract.
2. The transaction hash from the contract deployment (in text format).
3. The deployed contract address from the contract deployment (in text format).
