# 5. Deploy the ERC20 Proxy Contract for the Deposited SUDT

To use bridged ETH or other tokens transferred to Nervos Layer 2 you need to deploy a special ERC20 Proxy smart contract to interact with them. This smart contract has been prepared by the Nervos team and it overrides token balance and transfer methods so they both work with SUDTs bridged to Layer 2. Because open-source is at the heart of the whole Nervos multi-layer architecture you can browse its full Solidity code [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/solidity/erc20/SudtERC20Proxy.sol).

To deploy ERC20 Proxy smart contract you need to have Layer 2 SUDT ID. You can get it as a result of depositing SUDT to Layer 2 via account-cli tool.

If you don't have token or its Layer 2 ID yet, follow ["Issue an SUDT Token on Layer 1, then Deposit it to Polyjuice on Layer 2"](./4.issue.sudt.deposit.md) tutorial to create and deposit a token.

## Requirements

Before starting, you will need to setup your development environment. For information about setup and requirements please [review this article](../tasks-setup-and-requirements/tasks-setup-and-requirements.md).

## Task Instructions

> Note: Before you complete the tasks, be sure to review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

First you will have to clone the repository with example code. Then you will have to adjust values in these scripts such as your private key, Ethereum address ([make sure your address has funds on Layer 2](../component-tutorials/11.layer2.deposit.md)). After you fill the values you will be able to easily deploy a proxy smart contract and check your SUDT balance on Nervos' Layer 2!

> Note: Your private keys are used to secure your accounts and all the funds and assets contained within. It is important to keep your private keys safe, and to only use them with tools you can trust. However, on these tasks we will only be working with Testnet funds and assets that have no value. You can operate without concern knowing that there is nothing at risk.

### 1. Clone and Setup the Gitcoin Task Instruction Examples

In this step you have to clone the Gitcoin Task Instructions examples repository, which contains the example code required by the tasks. The code we will be working with in this step will compile your smart contract and deploy it. This uses the original versions of Web3.js and Truffle for Ethereum, with only a small difference in that they use a custom Web3.js provider.

Execute following commands to clone the Git repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction
cd gw-gitcoin-instruction/src/examples/5-erc20-proxy
yarn
```

### 2. Compile the Smart Contract and Copy the Artifact

Before you deploy a smart-contract you need to compile it. Our instructions will show you how to quickly compile a smart-contract using the Truffle compiler.

The SUDT-ERC20 Proxy Solidity smart contract below is `SudtERC20Proxy.sol`, and it is located in the [src/examples/5-erc20-proxy/contracts/SudtERC20Proxy.sol](../examples/5-erc20-proxy/contracts/SudtERC20Proxy.sol) file.

The command below can be used to compile the Solidity into EVM bytecode using the Truffle compiler. This process will use Docker. If you do not have Docker installed, please revisit the [task setup and requirements](../task-setup-and-requirements/task-setup-and-requirements.md) page.

```sh
yarn compile
```

After the command is complete you will find the compiled file in the `build/contracts` directory. ie: `src/examples/5-erc20-proxy/build/contracts/SudtERC20Proxy.json`

### 3. Deploy a SUDT-ERC20 Proxy Contract Using Web3.js

In the [`/src/examples/5-erc20-proxy/` directory](../examples/5-erc20-proxy/) you will find everything needed to deploy a SUDT-ERC20 proxy smart contract to Nervos Layer 2.

First, update the Ethereum private key in the file [/src/examples/5-erc20-proxy/index.js](../examples/5-erc20-proxy/index.js). Replace the value of the `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` constant with Ethereum private key that you recorded earlier. This should be the private key that corresponds with the Ethereum account that was funded previously.

Run the [/src/examples/5-erc20-proxy/index.js](../examples/5-erc20-proxy/index.js) script via console using the following commands:

```sh
cd /src/examples/5-erc20-proxy
yarn
node index.js
```

After running the command, the contract should deploy without any errors. You will be presented with a transaction hash, and an Ethereum contract address. The transaction hash is provided by Godwoken, and Ethereum contract address is provided by Polyjuice. Keep track of these values as they will be needed in the future tasks and for task submission.

### 4. Check your Layer 2 SUDT balance

As soon as the SUDT-ERC20 proxy smart contract has been deployed for your SUDT bridged to the Layer 2 you can check any account token balance. You can do this by calling `ERC20ProxyContract.balanceOf` method. It accepts account or smart-contract address as first and the only argument. One important thing to remember though is that this is a **Polyjuice address**, not your Ethereum address. Almost always when you're dealing with addresses on-chain in smart contract calls you want to use Polyjuice addresses.

**What is a Polyjuice address?**

A Polyjuice address is the address on Nervos Layer 2 corresponding to the Ethereum address behind it. The concept of Polyjuice address exists because of the cross-chain Layer 2 architecture. You can't just use Ethereum address on Nervos Layer 2 chain because Nervos Layer 2 is made to also support Tron and other blockchains accounts. The addresses from all these different blockchains, including Nervos need to be standardized in some way in the Layer 2. That's why it's using Polyjuice address.

Don't worry though, it's extremely easy to go from the Ethereum to Polyjuice address and vice-versa. A JavaScript code that is doing just that is included in [`examples/5-erc20-proxy/check-sudt-balance.js`](../examples/5-erc20-proxy/check-sudt-balance.js). You can also use `account-cli` tool to do a one time conversion using command-line. [You can find the `account-cli` instructions here.](../component-tutorials/12.setup.and.use.account.cli.md#address-conversion)

**Run check balance command**

Before running the command you need to prepare the script. Go to [`examples/5-erc20-proxy/check-sudt-balance.js`](../examples/5-erc20-proxy/check-sudt-balance.js) and replace with proper values:

- `<YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS` - the Ethereum address that you've deposited your SUDT to.
- `<YOUR_SUDT_PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` - You should have received SUDT-ERC20 proxy contract address as a result of previous step of this tutorial (deploying proxy smart contract).

After you've replaced the values you can now check the SUDT balance of your address on Layer 2.

```
node check-sudt-balance.js
```

```
➜ node check-sudt-balance.js

80
```
</details>

Congratulations, if the number you see at the end of the console output is higher than 0 it means you've successfully deployed a proxy contract and checked the balance of your account!

If the value is 0 deposit some SUDT tokens first to Layer 2 Ethereum address that you're checking.

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A deployed SUDT-ERC20 proxy smart-contract address.
2. A screenshot of the console output immediately after deploying smart-contract.
