# Initiate Withdrawal Process From the Layer 2 Back to Layer 1

<hr/>

The natural part of the process of using a blockchain Layer 2 network is being able to withdraw funds. In Layer 1 networks this concept often exists by the means of exchanges or bridges.

In Godwoken the most fundamental way of getting your funds out of it is to use built-in withdraw mechanism.

Due to the nature of the Godwoken (Optimistic Rollup architecture) it is a slow process. You need to wait five days between starting the withdrawal process and actually receiving funds back on Layer 1. This is because of security reasons. The mandatory wait duration is called "challenge" period and it gives Layer 2 network operators a time to check and challenge the malicious transactions.

> Note 1: An Optimistic Rollup security assumption is that there is at least one honest node in the network.

> Note 2: It is possible that in future there will exist other solutions allowing for faster exits.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will use Godwoken Examples Tools Package repository to run "withdraw" command. It will initiate withdrawal process.

After you run "withdraw" command you need to wait for five days unless your funds can be "unlocked". The instructions how to do that are in a separate tutorial.

The above is due to the nature of Optimistic Rollup.  A longer, so-called "challenge" period allows the node in the network to submit the challenge and rollback malicious transactions in case something goes wrong.

This period between requesting withdrawal of the funds to being able to actually unlock it is necessary to make sure that the transactions in the network are valid and you are the true owner of the withdrawn assets.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [first task](./1.create.godwoken.account.md) to create a Godwoken account on the EVM Layer 2 Testnet. You will also need the private key and Testnet address from the first task in order to proceed. If you have not completed it, please do so now.

### 1. Execute "withdraw" command

Assuming you have met the prerequisites and created the account, you will have to execute "withdraw" command using Godwoken Examples Tools Package. It will initiate a withdrawal process.

```
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js withdraw -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -p <YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY> -o <YOUR_LAYER1_ADDRESS> -c <SHANNONS_AMOUNT>
```

Example final command with all the variables filled in:

```sh
cd godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js withdraw -c 40000000000 -p 0xd9066ff9f753a1898709b568119055660a77d9aae4d7a4ad677b8fb3d2a571e5 -o ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju -r http://3.235.223.161:18114
```

Congratulations! If you see *"Success! Withdrawal request sent. You need to wait now for challenge period duration to unlock the funds."* message at the end it means you have successfully initiated a withdrawal process.

> Note: That's it for this task. Remember withdrawing from Nervos Layer 2 is a two step process. You need to wait now for the challenge period duration to actually receive the funds back on the Layer 1 and then execute "unlock" command.

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A screenshot of the console output immediately after running the "withdraw" command.
2. The Ethereum address that you've used for your Layer 2 account.
3. The Nervos Layer 1 address that you passed to "withdraw" command.
