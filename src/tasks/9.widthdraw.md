# Withdraw CKB from the second account on Layer 2 back to Layer 1

## [üöß] WORK IN PROGRESS 

Beware, this task is still a work in progress. Here be dragons. üê≤

<hr/>

The natural part of the process of using a blockchain Layer 2 network is being able to withdraw funds. In Layer 1s this concept often exists by the means of exchanges or bridges.

In Godwoken the most fundamental way of getting your funds out of it is to use built-in withdraw mechanism.

Due to the nature of the Godwoken (Optimistic Rollup architecture) it is a slow process. This is because of security reasons and giving rollup operators a time to check and challenge the malicious transactions.

> Note 1: An Optimistic Rollup security assumption is that there is at least one honest node in the network.

> Note 2: It is possible that in future there will exist other solutions allowing for faster exits.

## Task Instructions

In this task you will use Godwoken Examples Tools Package repository to first run "withdraw" and then "unlock" command.

After you run "withdraw" command you need to wait for a period of time unless your funds can be "unlocked".

This is due to the nature of Optimistic Rollup.  A longer, so-called "challenge" period allows the node in the network to submit the challenge and rollback malicious transactions in case something goes wrong.

This period between requesting withdrawal of the funds to being able to actually unlock it is necessary to make sure that the transactions in the network are valid and you are really the owner of the withdrawn assets.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin on this task you must complete the [first task](./1.create.godwoken.account.md) to create a Godwoken account on the EVM Layer 2 Testnet. You will also need the private key and Testnet address from the previous task in order to proceed. If you have not completed it, please do so now.

### 1. Execute "withdraw" command

Assuming you have met the prerequisites and created the account, you will have to execute "withdraw" command now using Godwoken Examples Tools Package.

```
cd ~/projects/godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js withdraw -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -p <YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY> -o <YOUR_LAYER1_ADDRESS> -c <SHANNONS_AMOUNT>
```

Example final command with all variables filled in:

```sh
cd ~/projects/godwoken-examples
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js withdraw -c 40000000000 -p 0xd9066ff9f753a1898709b568119055660a77d9aae4d7a4ad677b8fb3d2a571e5 -o ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju
