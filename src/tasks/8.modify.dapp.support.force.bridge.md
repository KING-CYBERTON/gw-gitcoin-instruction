# 8. Modify the Ported dApp so it Supports Ethereum Assets via Force Bridge

To modify your Ethereum application to support assets from the Ethereum you need to integrate Portal Wallet library into your application first to calculate the receiving addresses for the transfers through the bridge from the Ethereum. After the transfer through the bridge is completed your users will be able to use the transferred token on Layer 2 in your application.

## Requirements

Before starting, you will need to setup your development environment. For information about setup and requirements please [review this article](../tasks-setup-and-requirements/tasks-setup-and-requirements.md).


## Task Instructions

> Note: Before starting the tasks, it is recommended that you review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

### Install dependencies

```
yarn add nervos-godwoken-integration@0.0.2
```

### Generate Layer 2 Deposit Address

```js
import { AddressTranslator } from 'nervos-godwoken-integration';

// ...

const addressTranslator = new AddressTranslator();
const polyjuiceAddress = addressTranslator. getLayer2DepositAddress(web3, ethereumAddress);
```


1. Use nervos-godwoken-integration to generate layer 2 deposit address for user based on his Ethereum address.
2. Redirect user to Force Bridge website and tell him to bridge Ethereum to deposit address generated in step 1.
3. Deploy ERC20 Proxy smart contract for bridged asset. You need to do it only once per asset, all users can use it later. If you are bridging Ethereum on testnet it has constant SUDT ID equal to 142. 
4. Calculate user's Polyjuice address.
5. Add check balance smart contract call to your application. Use Polyjuice address from the previous step to check the balance.

At this point if the user has already completed his bridge transfer he can check the balance. If the balance is higher than zero it means you can just use this token as you would use any ERC20 token in your application.

> Note: If you would like to have more control over the bridge transfer and build your own frontend you can take advantage of [`BridgeRPCHandler`](https://github.com/Roger-RumbleFish/nervos-godwoken-integration/blob/master/src/bridge/force-bridge-handler.ts) exposed by `nervos-godwoken-integration`.
