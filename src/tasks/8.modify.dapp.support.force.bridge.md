# 8. Modify the Ported dApp so it Supports Ethereum Assets via Force Bridge

One of the biggest challenges to mass adoption is making applications that are both secure and easy for the end user. The landscape of tooling and infrastructure is a challenge for developers who must fight with the delicate balance that they deliver to their users. The tools are often complicated and difficult to use. The infrastructure lacks standardization and seamless compatibility. While progress continues to be made, the end is still not yet in sight.

Competition is fierce in the blockchain world, and protocols are being reinvented as fast as they are being adopted. There are big challenges in blockchain that have yet to be solved, and multiple industry leaders are taking very different approaches to their solutions. The standards that have emerged are still evolved, and the ability to integrate between these different pieces of infrastructure is still a challenge that has yet to be addressed.

The flexibility of Nervos' underlying platform is a big step towards the future of deeply integrated experiences that are simplified and accessible to the average every day user. Developers can adapt and extend the platform to whatever solutions are in use today, rather than having to wait for the solution to be developed. Developers are able to mix and match layers of infrastructure like lego bricks, then unify a stream of motions into a single simplified action for the user. We'll demonstrate one such example in this task.

## Task Instructions

> Note: Before starting the tasks, it is recommended that you review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

Modify your existing EVM dApp from the [previous task](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/7.port.eth.dapp.md) to support one-step asset transfers using Force Bridge. This is done by integrating the `nervos-godwoken-integration` library into your application.

Your dApp will calculate special receiving addresses for transfers from Ethereum through Force Bridge. These addresses will allow users to transfer the assets through Force Bridge directly to Layer 2 so they are ready for your application to interact with.

In this task we will describe the changes that need to be made, but there is no example project. You will need to make these changes to your own application in order to get credit for completing the task.

### 1.Install Godwoken Integration Package

The first step is to install the `nervos-godwoken-integration` package. This package contains the tools needed to integrate Nervos' Layer 2 infrastructure into your application.

```sh
yarn add nervos-godwoken-integration@0.0.2
```

### 2. Generate a Layer 2 Deposit Address on Layer 1

A layer 2 Deposit address is an address on Nervos' Layer 1 that acts as a gateway into Layer 2. All CKBytes and SUDT tokens transferred to this address on Layer 1 will be automatically collected by the block producing nodes and delivered to Layer 2.

The code snippet below can be used to generate a Layer 2 deposit address after replacing `<ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>` with the user's Ethereum address on Layer 2.

```js
const { AddressTranslator } = require('nervos-godwoken-integration');

const addressTranslator = new AddressTranslator();
const depositAddress = await addressTranslator.getLayer2DepositAddress(web3, <ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>);

console.log(`Layer 2 Deposit Address on Layer 1: \n${depositAddress.addressString}`);
```

### 3. Redirect the User to the Force Bridge Website

After your application has calculated and displayed the user's deposit address, you can instruct them to use the Force Bridge website:

- https://force-bridge-test.ckbapp.dev/bridge/Ethereum/Nervos

Optionally, you can specify the asset to be transferred so it is already populated. Below is the link for pre-selecting ETH:

- https://force-bridge-test.ckbapp.dev/bridge/Ethereum/Nervos?xchain-asset=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The user should be instructed to input their Layer 2 Deposit Address as the `Receiver` address from the previous step.

A complete guide on how to do a transfer through the Force Bridge is available through [this tutorial](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/tasks/6.use.force.bridge.to.deposit.md#3-initiate-a-force-bridge-transfer).

### 4. Calculate the User's Polyjuice Address

After the user has completed the Force Bridge transfer, your application needs a way to detect it. One of the most simple ways to do this is to display the user's balance for specific assets, and have the balance update at regular intervals.

In order to check a user's balance for any asset, you first need the Polyjuice address for their Ethereum address. This is needed because the SUDT-ERC20 Proxy Contract requires a Polyjuice address.

This the code for calculating a Polyjuice address from the Ethereum address:

```js
const { AddressTranslator } = require('nervos-godwoken-integration');

const addressTranslator = new AddressTranslator();
const polyjuiceAddress = addressTranslator.ethAddressToGodwokenShortAddress(ETHEREUM_ADDRESS);

console.log(`Polyjuice Address: ${polyjuiceAddress}\n`);
```

### 5. Adding the User's Layer 2 Balance to Your Application

When an asset is transferred to Nervos' Layer 2, it is in the form of an SUDT token. In order for an EVM application to interact with it, the SUDT-ERC20 Proxy Contract must be used.

To determine the SUDT balance for a user, call the `balanceOf()` function on the SUDT-ERC20 Proxy Contract which has been deployed with the SUDT ID matching the correct asset. The `balanceOf()` function takes the user's Polyjuice address as an argument, which we found in the previous step.

If you need a reminder on how to deploy the ERC20 Proxy Contract and check the balance, please review [task 5](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/tasks/5.deploy.erc20.proxy.contract.md), and review the example code [here](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/examples/5-erc20-proxy/check-sudt-balance.js).

Using these resources, you should be able to display the user's asset balance on your application's website.

## Task Submission

To complete the task, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. A screenshot or video of your EVM application on Layer 2 with Force Bridge support.
2. The address of the SUDT-ERC20 Proxy Contract that you deployed (in text format).
3. A link to the GitHub repository with your EVM application that integrates Force Bridge support.

## Bonus: Add Integrated Force Bridge Support to Your Application

Force Bridge has its own website, but all of the functionality it has can be integrated directly into your application. This means that the end user can initial an asset transfer from Ethereum to Nervos' Layer 2 without ever having to leave your application for any part of the process.

This can be done by building a frontend interface for Force Bridge in your application that takes advantage of [`BridgeRPCHandler`](https://github.com/Roger-RumbleFish/nervos-godwoken-integration/blob/master/src/bridge/force-bridge-handler.ts) which is exposed by `nervos-godwoken-integration`. This can eliminate a need for redirecting user outside of your application. However, this is considered to be more advanced functionality that may be substaintially more difficult to integrate, and it is not covered by this guide.
