# 6. Use Force Bridge to Deposit Tokens on Ethereum to Polyjuice

In this tutorial you will bridge Rinkeby ETH to ckETH on Nervos Layer 2. ETH is a native asset on its own chain but you will receive it as SUDT token on Nervos Layer 2, since native token on Nervos Layer 2 testnet is testnet CKB.

## 1. Use this [tool](https://github.com/huwenchao/godwoken-testnet#quick-start-with-nodejs-script) to calculate your deposit receiver address

Make sure you use updated deployment-results from the [upstream godwoken-testnet repository](https://github.com/jjyr/godwoken-testnet).

## 2. Go to [https://force-bridge-dev.ckbapp.dev](https://force-bridge-dev.ckbapp.dev/bridge/Ethereum/Nervos?xchain-asset=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) to use Force Bridge

Make sure you have Rinkeby network selected in MetaMask. To use the bridge you also need Rinkeby ETH. You can get it from faucet.

You should bridge from ETH to ckETH. If ETH isn't already selected as the source asset then click on "From" and choose "ETH" from the list.

After you've selected the asset you want to bridge, input the amount of the transferred funds. Received amount below will be automatically recalculated and you can't change it. There will be also a small fee to the transfer, so the transferred asset amount won't be exactly the same as you've entered.

In the next step change the `Recipient` address to the one which you already caculated from step 1. This will make sure that when your bridged transaction is complete it will be automatically collected by Layer 2 operator and your ckETH balance on Layer 2 will increase.

When you've entered all the details then click `Bridge` button. You will be asked to sign a MetaMask transaction. This transaction is going to send Rinkeby ETH to the bridge, so you can later receive it on Layer 2.

When you confirm the transaction in the MetaMask you will get a modal with a link to Etherscan, where you can see the progress of mining your transaction on the Ethereum chain. 

You will also see the transaction in **History** section of the UI in the **Pending** tab. First it will be in "lock asset on Ethereum (x/15)" state, where X is the number of block confirmations on the Ethereum chain. It has to have at least 15 confirmations:

When there is at least 15 block confirmations your pending transaction will transition to "lock asset on Ethereum (confirmed)" state:

It doesn't mean the whole transfer through the bridge is complete, because this is a two-step process. Ethereum transaction was just the first part. Now bridge will send transaction on Nervos Layer 1 so your funds are visible as SUDT. When this happens your transaction will move to "Succeed" tab:

At this point there is one last step - Nervos Layer 2 operator has to collect the funds from Layer 1 and deposit it into Layer 2. It will happen automatically, and after this process you should see your token balance increased.
