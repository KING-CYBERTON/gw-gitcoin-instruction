# 7. Port an Existing Ethereum dApp to Polyjuice

In this tutorial you will learn how to port an existing browser Ethereum application to Nervos' Layer 2. 

## Requirements

Before starting, you will need to setup your development environment. For information about setup and requirements please [review this article](../tasks-setup-and-requirements/tasks-setup-and-requirements.md).


## Task Instructions

> Note: Before you complete the tasks, be sure to review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

User interface and interaction with the smart-contracts will be done through MetaMask so the overall user experience will be quite similar to Ethereum apps.

In this guide we assume you have application that is using web3.js. Ethers.js guides can be found in ["Additional tutorials and code examples"](#additional-tutorials-and-code-examples).

### Install MetaMask and setup Godwoken Testnet network

### Provided demo application to port

You can use existing Ethereum application that we've put together for this tutorial to follow along. It is using Simple Storage smart contract where you can read and set the stored number value. It is built with React.js and Web3.js.

### Install dependencies

A first step is to install required NPM packages. In `package.json` of your application add following dependencies:
```js
"@polyjuice-provider/web3": "0.0.1-rc5",
"nervos-godwoken-integration": "^0.0.2",
```

- `@polyjuice-provider/web3` is a custom Polyjuice web3 provider. It is absolutely required for interaction with Nervos' Layer 2 smart contracts.
- `nervos-godwoken-integration` is a handy tool that can generate Polyjuice address based on your Ethereum address. You might be required to use Polyjuice address if you store values mapped to addresses in your contracts.

### Change Web3 provider

The second step is to use the packages you've just installed. Change the web3 provider URL from the one that you currently use for Ethereum to Godwoken testnet. For example change:
```js
export const CONFIG = {
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URL: 'http://localhost:8545'
};
```

to:
```js
export const CONFIG = {
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URL: 'http://godwoken-testnet-web3-rpc.ckbapp.dev'
};
```

> Note: You might not have a global config for storing provider URL. In this case just go to the place where you initialize your web3.js provider instance and change it there. Chances are you've been using Ganache or Infura so far to interact with Ethereum. If you have trouble finding the place in your code you can globally search for `localhost:8545` or `infura` string and replace it with Godwoken value.

You should also add two more entries which are specific to Godwoken to this global config. They will be helpful in the next step. They are `ROLLUP_TYPE_HASH` and `ETH_ACCOUNT_LOCK_CODE_HASH`. They are required for creating Polyjuice provider. These values are constant for Godwoken testnet deployment and you can acquire them from [jjyr/godwoken-testnet repository](https://github.com/jjyr/godwoken-testnet). This is how your config should look in the end:
```js
export const CONFIG = {
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URL: 'http://godwoken-testnet-web3-rpc.ckbapp.dev',
    ROLLUP_TYPE_HASH: '0x9b260161e003972c0b699939bc164cfdcfce7fd40eb9135835008dd7e09d3dae',
    ETH_ACCOUNT_LOCK_CODE_HASH: '0xfcf093a5f1df4037cea259d49df005e0e7258b4f63e67233eda5b376b7fd2290'
};
```
> Note: We tend to use Nervos' Layer 2, Godwoken and Polyjuice names interchangeably. Don't worry though - at the high level you can think of them as the same thing.

> Note: If you're using provided demo application the config is located in `src/config.ts`.

It's time to use these constant values. In the place where you've previously created instance of your web3.js change it from:

```js
import Web3 from 'web3';

// ...

// it can be this or something similar
const web3 = new Web3((window as any).ethereum);
```

to:

```js
import Web3 from 'web3';

// Make sure to import the provider first!
import { PolyjuiceHttpProvider } from '@polyjuice-provider/web3';

// ...

const godwokenRpcUrl = CONFIG.WEB3_PROVIDER_URL;
const providerConfig = {
    rollupTypeHash: CONFIG.ROLLUP_TYPE_HASH,
    ethAccountLockCodeHash: CONFIG.ETH_ACCOUNT_LOCK_CODE_HASH,
    web3Url: godwokenRpcUrl
};

const provider = new PolyjuiceHttpProvider(godwokenRpcUrl, providerConfig);
const web3 = new Web3(provider);
```

The most important step is done! It's possible that your application will already start working just fine on Nervos' Layer 2!

There are, however, more steps to make sure it's stable and compatible. Check out the next steps below.

### Change gas price to 0

In all places where you send transactions you need to set the gas price to zero. This is the only value supported by Godwoken currently.

In SimpleStorageWrapper.ts create constant:
```js
const DEFAULT_SEND_OPTIONS = {
    gas: 6000000,
    gasPrice: '0'
};
```

And use it in all places where you send transactions. Eg. if you had:
```js
this.contract.methods.set(value).send({
    from: fromAddress
});
```

Then change it to:
```js
this.contract.methods.set(value).send({
    ...DEFAULT_SEND_OPTIONS,
    from: fromAddress
});
```

If you deploy a smart contract you need to additionally set "to" parameter to an empty address. For example:
```js
this.contract
    .deploy({
        data: SimpleStorageJSON.bytecode,
        arguments: []
    })
    .send({
        ...DEFAULT_SEND_OPTIONS,
        from: fromAddress,
        to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    })
```

### Use @nervosnetwork/polyjuice-provider

You have to replace the framework provider you're using in your code.

### Simple Storage Application ported to Godwoken codebase

If you want to see how the final ported application should look like go to the following repository: [Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop (branch: godwoken-simple)](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop/tree/godwoken-simple).

Clone it and start web user interface server to play around with it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop.git -b godwoken-simple blockchain-workshop-godwoken-simple
cd blockchain-workshop-godwoken-simple
yarn && yarn build && yarn ui
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 where you can test it out!

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. Link to the GitHub repository with your ported application.
2. A screenshot of your ported application.
3. If you deployed any smart contracts as part of this tutorial: transaction hash of the deployment transaction, deployed contract address and ABI of the deployed smart contract.

### Caveats

[In this document](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/EVM-compatible.md) you can find all the things different than Ethereum and potentially causing problems for you.

If you need to use `ecrecover` you will have to modify your smart-contracts to do an internal system call using assembly. You can find documentation for that syscall [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/Addition-Features.md).
