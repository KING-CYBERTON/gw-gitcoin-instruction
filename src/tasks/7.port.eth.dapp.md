# 7. Port an Existing Ethereum dApp to Polyjuice

In this tutorial you will learn how to port a browser Ethereum application to Nervos' Layer 2. 

## Requirements

Before starting, you will need to setup your development environment. For information about setup and requirements please [review this article](../tasks-setup-and-requirements/tasks-setup-and-requirements.md).


## Task Instructions

> Note: Before you complete the tasks, be sure to review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

User interface and interaction with the smart-contracts will be done through MetaMask so the overall user experience will be quite similar to Ethereum apps.

### Install MetaMask and setup Godwoken Testnet network

### Use @nervosnetwork/polyjuice-provider

You have to replace the framework provider you're using in your code.

### Simple Storage Application ported to Godwoken codebase

If you want to see how the final ported application should look like go to the following repository: [Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop (branch: godwoken-simple)](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop/tree/godwoken-simple).

Clone it and start web user interface server to play around with it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop.git -b godwoken-simple blockchain-workshop-godwoken-simple
cd blockchain-workshop-godwoken-simple
yarn && yarn build && yarn ui
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 where you can test it out!

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. Link to the GitHub repository with your ported application.
2. A screenshot of your ported application.
3. If you deployed any smart contracts as part of this tutorial: transaction hash of the deployment transaction, deployed contract address and ABI of the deployed smart contract.

### Caveats

[In this document](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/EVM-compatible.md) you can find all the things different than Ethereum and potentially causing problems for you.

If you need to use `ecrecover` you will have to modify your smart-contracts to do an internal system call using assembly. You can find documentation for that syscall [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/Addition-Features.md).
