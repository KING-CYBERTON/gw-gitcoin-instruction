# 7. Port an Existing Ethereum dApp to Polyjuice

In this tutorial you will learn how to port an existing browser Ethereum application to run on Nervos' EVM compatible [Layer 2](../conceptual-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2).

[MetaMask](../conceptual-explainers/wallets.md#metamask) is the primary method of interacting with dApps on Nervos. The over user experience will be very similar to existing Ethereum. The one big difference is that the MetaMask confirmation dialog will ask them to sign a hex string instead of displaying transaction. This is normal behavior when using MetaMask on Nervos since MetaMask is currently not capable of deciphering a [Godwoken](../conceptual-explainers/frameworks.md#godwoken) transaction.

The eventual goal of [Polyjuice](../conceptual-explainers/frameworks.md#polyjuice) is 100% compatibility with existing EVM smart contracts. However, this goal is still being worked on, and there will always be a few differences in the setup of the development environment and the tooling and frameworks that are used.

## Task Instructions

> Note: Before starting the tasks, it is recommended that you review the [Task Submission](#task-submission) section so you know what materials you will need to provide to judges to review your task submission.

In this task, you will need to port over an existing Ethereum dApp to Nervos' Layer 2. Our examples will use the Simple Storage smart contract, but your submission must be significantly different. Using the Simple Storage smart contract is allowed, but only the end result of your dApp is significant different than the example. If it your application is too similar to the example, it will be rejected by the judges. Our general suggestion is that you take an existing Ethereum dApp that you are already familiar with, then make the changes required to port it to Nervos.

In this guide we assume you have application that is using **Web3.js**. Instructions for Ethers.js can be found in ["Additional Tutorials and Code Examples"](#additional-tutorials-and-code-examples).

> Important: The example in this task uses the Simple Storage smart contract, but you cannot clone this code for your task. **In order to get credit for this task you must use a different project.**

### Prerequisites

Your MetaMask wallet should be installed and configured with the same Ethereum accounts from the previous tasks. Your MetaMask Ethereum account should still be funded on Layer 2 from the previous tasks.

### Setup the Godwoken Testnet Network in MetaMask

Your MetaMask wallet will need to be configured to communicate with the Godwoken Layer 2 network. To do this, you will need to configure a new custom RPC. From the network selection dropdown, select "Custom RPC".

<img src="../images/metamask-network-menu.png" alt="MetaMask Network Menu" style="height: 300px; border: 1px solid #eeeeee" />

From there you will be presented with a form to specify the network settings.

<img src="../images/metamask-networks.png" alt="MetaMask Add Network" style="height: 300px; border: 1px solid #eeeeee" />

Enter the following details.

```txt
Network Name: Godwoken Testnet
RPC URL: http://godwoken-testnet-web3-rpc.ckbapp.dev
Chain ID: 71393
Currency Symbol: <Leave Empty>
Block Explorer URL: <Leave Empty>
```

After MetaMask is configured you may see a zero balance even after you have deposited funds into this Ethereum address on Layer 2. Don't be alarmed by this. Later on we will show you how to setup your application to call `web3.eth.getBalance` with your Ethereum address to query for your balance.

### View the Ethereum Demo Application

A simple Ethereum demo application has been built to use the Simple Storage to read and write number values. We will walk through this Ethereum application, and demonstrate the changes needed to make this run on Nervos' Layer 2.

We recommend that you clone the source code and follow along with our explanations so you become familiar with the process invovled in porting an application.

> Note: Remember, the application you submit must be different from our example. This guide will walk you through the process, but you must port over a different application to submit your task.

First, we need to clone the repo. This contains the Ethereum version of the application before it has been updated to support Godwoken.

```sh
mkdir ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop.git -b ethereum-simple blockchain-workshop-ethereum-simple
cd blockchain-workshop-ethereum-simple
```

Next, install the dependencies, build the smart contracts, and start Ganache to run a local Ethereum development chain.

```sh
cd ~projects/blockchain-workshop-ethereum-simple
yarn
yarn build
yarn start:ganache
```

Ganache should now be running and creating blocks.

Switch back to your web browser. Open MetaMask and switch your network to `Localhost 8545`. It should switch and connect without giving an error now that Ganache is running.

<img src="../images/metamask-localhost.png" alt="MetaMask Localhost 8545" style="height: 300px; border: 1px solid #eeeeee"/>

In a second terminal, start the UI server.

```sh
cd ~projects/blockchain-workshop-ethereum-simple
yarn ui
```

The server should now be started, and you can open a browser tab to http://localhost:3000 to view the dApp UI!

### Install Polyjuice Dependencies

Now we will begin porting this Ethereum application to use Nervos' Layer 2. The first step is to install the required dependencies for working with Godwoken and Polyjuice. Use the following command in the main project directory to install these dependencies in your application.

```js
cd ~projects/blockchain-workshop-ethereum-simple
npm i @polyjuice-provider/web3@0.0.1-rc5 nervos-godwoken-integration@0.0.2
```

- `@polyjuice-provider/web3` is a custom Polyjuice web3 provider. It is required for interaction with Nervos' Layer 2 smart contracts.
- `nervos-godwoken-integration` is a tool that can generate Polyjuice address based on your Ethereum address. You might be required to use Polyjuice address if you store values mapped to addresses in your contracts.

### Configure the Web3 Provider for the Polyjuice Web3 Provider

The next step is to configure the Polyjuice Web3 Provider for the application. This replaces the normal web3 provider that may be currently in use for Ethereum with one for the Godwoken Testnet.

The example below is just for demonstration of how your configuration file could look. You will not find it in any of the example project source files.

```js
export const CONFIG = {
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URL: 'http://localhost:8545'
};
```

is changed to:

```js
export const CONFIG = {
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URL: 'http://godwoken-testnet-web3-rpc.ckbapp.dev'
};
```

> Note: Your configuration might be using `localhost:8545`, or some other settings for some other service like Infura.

The two other values needed for the Polyjuice Web3 Provider are the `ROLLUP_TYPE_HASH` and the `ETH_ACCOUNT_LOCK_CODE_HASH`. Both of these values are constants needed for the Godwoken Testnet. A full list of the various values for the Godwoken Testnet can be found [here](https://github.com/jjyr/godwoken-testnet).

We will add these values to our configuration object below. These values will be needed by our project, so we are creating a new config file called `config.ts` to our source code.

Here is the contents of the file `~projects/blockchain-workshop-ethereum-simple/src/config.ts` that we just created:

```js
export const CONFIG = {
    WEB3_PROVIDER_URL: 'http://godwoken-testnet-web3-rpc.ckbapp.dev',
    ROLLUP_TYPE_HASH: '0x9b260161e003972c0b699939bc164cfdcfce7fd40eb9135835008dd7e09d3dae',
    ETH_ACCOUNT_LOCK_CODE_HASH: '0xfcf093a5f1df4037cea259d49df005e0e7258b4f63e67233eda5b376b7fd2290'
};
```

We will use these config values in a moment, but first we need to import a few dependencies. We will update the main UI in the file `~projects/blockchain-workshop-ethereum-simple/src/ui/app.tsx`.

Next, we add the following lines in the main dependency importation section of the file.

```js
import { PolyjuiceHttpProvider } from '@polyjuice-provider/web3';
import { CONFIG } from '../config';
```

This imports the Polyjuice Web3 Provider, which we will use in a moment, and the config file that we just created.

Next we prepare a few constants, create the Polyjuice Provider, and use the Polyjuice Provider with a Web3 instance.

```js
const godwokenRpcUrl = CONFIG.WEB3_PROVIDER_URL;
const providerConfig = {
    rollupTypeHash: CONFIG.ROLLUP_TYPE_HASH,
    ethAccountLockCodeHash: CONFIG.ETH_ACCOUNT_LOCK_CODE_HASH,
    web3Url: godwokenRpcUrl
};
const provider = new PolyjuiceHttpProvider(godwokenRpcUrl, providerConfig);
const web3 = new Web3(provider);
```

The above code is a Web3 instance using a Polyjuice Web3 Provider. We will just call it "Polyjuice Web3" for short. We need to take this code and replace the existing Ethereum Web3 instance. In `app.tsx`, locate the existing Web3 instance, which should match the line below.

```js
const web3 = new Web3((window as any).ethereum);
```

Delete this line, and replace it with the Polyjuice Web3 code from above. Now our application is setup to communicate with Polyjuice using Web3!

### Change Gas Price to Zero

In all places where you send transactions you need to set the gas price to zero. This is the only value supported by Godwoken currently.

You can create a constant value:

```js
const DEFAULT_SEND_OPTIONS = {
    gas: 6000000,
    gasPrice: '0'
};
```

And use it in all places where you send transactions. Eg. if you had:

```js
this.contract.methods.set(value).send({
    from: fromAddress
});
```

Then change it to:

```js
this.contract.methods.set(value).send({
    ...DEFAULT_SEND_OPTIONS,
    from: fromAddress
});
```

If you deploy a smart contract you need to additionally set "to" parameter to an empty address. For example:

```js
this.contract
    .deploy({
        data: SimpleStorageJSON.bytecode,
        arguments: []
    })
    .send({
        ...DEFAULT_SEND_OPTIONS,
        from: fromAddress,
        to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    })
```

Also, the return value of the above code will be a Promise object resolving to transaction details. To get the deployed contract address you need to get `contractAddress` property of this transaction. This is example how you would do it:

```js
async deploy(fromAddress: string) {
    const deployTx = await (this.contract
        .deploy({
            data: SimpleStorageJSON.bytecode,
            arguments: []
        })
        .send({
            ...DEFAULT_SEND_OPTIONS,
            from: fromAddress,
            to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
        } as any) as any);

    this.useDeployed(deployTx.contractAddress);

    return deployTx.transactionHash;
}
```

> Note: In provided demo application you should change it in `src/lib/contracts/SimpleStorageWrapper.ts` which acts as an abstraction layer over direct smart contract calls.

### Display Polyjuice Address in Your Application

Because every Ethereum address becomes Polyjuice address on Nervos' Layer 2 chain you might find it useful to have tool to convert Ethereum address to Polyjuice in your JavaScript code. Therefore if you have a place where you would like to use just do the following:

```js
import { AddressTranslator } from 'nervos-godwoken-integration';

// ...

const addressTranslator = new AddressTranslator();
const polyjuiceAddress = addressTranslator.ethAddressToGodwokenShortAddress(ethereumAddress);
```

### Simple Storage Application Ported to Godwoken

If you want to see how the final ported application should look like go to the following repository: [Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop (branch: godwoken-simple)](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop/tree/godwoken-simple).

Clone it and start web user interface server to play around with it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop.git -b godwoken-simple blockchain-workshop-godwoken-simple
cd blockchain-workshop-godwoken-simple
yarn && yarn build && yarn ui
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 where you can test it out!

## Task Submission

To complete the tasks, you will need to submit the following materials for review by the judges:

1. Link to the GitHub repository with your ported application **different from our Simple Storage application** example. Please use a different smart contract or multiple smart contracts.
2. A screenshot or video of your ported application.
3. If you deployed any smart contracts as part of this tutorial you can also provide: transaction hash of the deployment transaction, deployed contract address and ABI of the deployed smart contract.

### Caveats

[In this document](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/EVM-compatible.md) you can find all the things different than Ethereum and potentially causing problems for you.

If you need to use `ecrecover` you will have to modify your smart-contracts to do an internal system call using assembly. You can find documentation for that syscall [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/Addition-Features.md), there is an [example code](https://github.com/RetricSu/godwoken-polyjuice-compatibility-examples#compatibility).
