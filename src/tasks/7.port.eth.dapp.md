# 7. Port an Existing Ethereum dApp to Polyjuice

## Introduction

Typical code architecture of Ethereum application consists of two parts:
1. Smart-contracts deployment 
2. User interface and interaction with the smart contracts

In this tutorial you will learn how to port both codebases to Nervos Layer 2.

## Use @nervosnetwork/polyjuice-provider

You have to replace the framework provider you're using in your code.

### Web3.js

### Ethers.js

## Caveats

[In this document](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/EVM-compatible.md) you can find all the things different than Ethereum and potentially causing problems for you.

If you need to use `ecrecover` you will have to modify your smart contracts to do an internal system call using assembly. You can find documentation for that syscall [here](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/godwoken-polyjuice/blob/main/docs/Addition-Features.md).

## More examples

If you need more examples of working Nervos Layer 2 applications you can take a look at the following codebases:
