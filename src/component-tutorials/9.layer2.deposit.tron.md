# Create a Godwoken Account by Making a Layer 2 Deposit Using Tron Wallet

Before a user can start using Godwoken, they first need to create an account. Creating an account on Layer 2 begins with the first logical step, depositing funds from Layer 1 to Layer 2. This single action creates the account and funds it so it is ready to be used.

## 1. Setup the Godwoken Examples Tool Package

The first step is to setup the Godwoken Examples tool package. This is a collection of scripts that has been created to help with commonly needed actions when dealing with Layer 2. These actions include the deposit and withdrawl of CKBytes and SUDT tokens to and from Layer 2.

To setup the Godwoken Examples tool package, follow the [this tutorial](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/component-tutorials/3.setup.and.use.account.cli.md).

## 2. Make a Deposit to Layer 2

The next step is to deposit some CKBytes from Layer 1 to Layer 2. To do this we need the private key of your Layer 1 account, and we also need to know what your Tron address is so we can depost to it on Layer 2.

First, we need to find the private key that was generated for your Layer 1 account. It should look something like this:

```txt
0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18
```

Note: The above line is our demonstration private key. You need to use the private key you generated earlier.

Next, we need to locate your Tron address. You can find this by opening TronLink and clicking on the icon to the right of address field to copy it.

Then we use the `account-cli` tool to make the deposit by providing your private key, and the Tron address you are depositing to:

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -p <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> --tron-address <YOUR_TRON_ADDRESS> -c <SHANNONS_AMOUNT>
```

1. `<INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet CKB node you will use. This should be your local address if you are using a local node, or it can be a public address if you're using a public node.\
Local Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8114`\
Public Testnet CKB Node URL: `http://3.235.223.161:18114`
2. `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` The private key to your Nervos Layer 1 account. Make sure your account has been funded with Testnet CKBytes from the [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.nervos.org/).
3. `<YOUR_TRON_ADDRESS>` - The Tron address of your account from TronLink. This will be used to receive funds on Layer 2. This can be found in TronLink by clicking the icon next to address within the wallet as seen in [step 2](#2-make-a-deposit-to-layer-2) of this tutorial.
4. `<SHANNONS_AMOUNT>` - The amount of CKBytes to transfer, written in Shannons. A Shannon is a unit of measurement in Nervos that is the equivalent of a Satoshi in Bitcoin. We recommend depositing 1,000 CKBytes, which is the minimum number required by Godwoken. There are 100,000,000 Shannons in a CKByte, and this value must be expressed in Shannons. ie: 1,000 * 100,000,000 = 100,000,000,000

Example final command with all values filled in:

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 --tron-address TFrSJCrSJai8H2Kc32TP3nEzuWsXu8YnUJ -c 100000000000
```

> Note: Minimum deposit value is 1000 CKB. If you try depositing amount lower than that it will fail.
