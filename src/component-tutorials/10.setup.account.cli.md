# 10. Setup Layer 1 account with funds

## Introduction

To perform actions on Nervos network such as creating Layer 2 EVM accounts and interact with smart-contracts you need to have an account on Layer 1. Layer 1 and Layer 2 are different Nervos blockchains but the important part is they work together. You don't need to know everything, but the second important thing is Layer 2 supports Ethereum smart-contracts.

You also need some funds. Because in this example you're working with testnet these funds are free and have no value. These are just for testing purposes.

For creating the account we will use command-line tool.

## Install ckb-cli

### Linux

At the beginning run a few commands below to create `projects` directory in your user directory. In this directory you'll download CKB binary and add it to binaries path, so it works when you use `ckb-cli` command. 

It's not obligatory to create `projects` directory, but it's a good way to organize the files. You will have an easier time later managing those directories.

Open Linux terminal and run following commands:

```
cd ~
mkdir projects
cd projects
curl -O https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-cli/releases/download/v0.43.0/ckb-cli_v0.43.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -L
tar -xvzf ckb-cli_v0.43.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
mv ckb-cli_v0.43.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz ckb-cli-0.43
```

Now, add `ckb-cli` binary to system path. It is needed so when you use this command in terminal it is found. If you use bash:

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Or if you use Zsh:
```
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Then after you've opened proper file - add the following line at the end of it (note that I've put `ckb-cli-0.43` directory in the `~/projects` folder, adjust it for your setup):

```
export PATH=$HOME/projects/ckb-cli-0.43:$PATH
```

Now restart terminal session and run:

```
ckb-cli
```

It should print something like this:
```
  _   _   ______   _____   __      __   ____     _____
 | \ | | |  ____| |  __ \  \ \    / /  / __ \   / ____|
 |  \| | | |__    | |__) |  \ \  / /  | |  | | | (___
 | . ` | |  __|   |  _  /    \ \/ /   | |  | |  \___ \
 | |\  | | |____  | | \ \     \  /    | |__| |  ____) |
 |_| \_| |______| |_|  \_\     \/      \____/  |_____/

[  ckb-cli version ]: 0.42.1 (1edba56 2021-05-25)
[              url ]: http://127.0.0.1:8114 (network: Dev)
[              pwd ]: /home/kuzi/projects/godwoken-kicker
[            color ]: true
[            debug ]: false
[          no-sync ]: false
[    output format ]: yaml
[ completion style ]: List
[       edit style ]: Emacs
[   index db state ]: Waiting for first query
```
If it doesn't work and system can't find the `ckb-cli` command something is misconfigured.

It also started interactive session. You can type `exit` and press enter to leave the interactive `ckb-cli` session.

## Create account

You can use `ckb-cli` to generate an account for you.

Run following command:
```sh
ckb-cli account new
```

It will ask you for a password to secure your account. Pick a password that you're going to remember later on. Type password into the tool and press "Enter". Then repeat the password and press "Enter" again.

After the action is done you will see the following output:

``` sh
address:
  mainnet: ckb1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefsr0wk7q
  testnet: ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju
lock_arg: 0x5e518242edf98063d632c1f7ce5716381b724653
lock_hash: 0x5c7253696786b9eddd34e4f6b6e478ec5742bd36569ec60c1d0487480ba4f9e3
```

What is important for you is the testnet address. This is the address of your account on Nervos Layer 1. Congratulations! You've just created it. üëè

Next step is to setup your Layer 1 account with funds. You need some free testing currency on Nervos so you can perform actions. The instruction how to do that for free is just below.

## Get free testing currency from faucet

Now you can go to the testnet faucet - https://faucet.nervos.org/ - where you can get some funds. 

<img src="../images/faucet-enter.png" height="200" />

Paste your wallet address into big "Enter your Aggron wallet address" input box. The address is the "testnet" entry from creating new account command.

Example testnet address is: ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju (don't use this one, use the one you created)

When the input box is filled click "Claim" button. Your transaction will become pending and you should receive funds shortly. It usually takes up to few minutes. After this transaction completes you will be ready to go.

Transaction is first in pending state:

<img src="../images/faucet-pending.png" height="200" />

Then it completes:

<img src="../images/faucet-completed.png" height="200" />

As you've seen above you can follow receiving funds progress on the website.

## Balance

When the transaction is finally done you should see an increased balance in your wallet. To check the balance in ckb-cli use the following command:
```
ckb-cli wallet get-capacity --address YOUR_TESTNET_ADDRESS
```

As the result of this command you should see that the capacity (CKB) in your wallet has increased after you requested funds from faucet. It can take some time for the funds to show up.

If the output of the command is something like:
```
total: 10000 (CKB)
```

Then it means you've performed the actions correctly. These are your testnet funds ready to use! Enjoy!

*Tip: Remember you can always come back to the faucet when you need funds again. One thing to note though is after requesting funds you need to wait 24 hours to request the funds again to the same CKB address.*

## Export private key

The private key gives access to your funds.

Exporting private key is something you should be very cautious about. You should never share your private key with someone else. 

In this example though if we want to use other tools - for example to create account on Layer 2, deploy smart-contracts and interact with them - these tools need to access your funds to perform operations for you. Since we're on testnet it's all for testing purposes and the funds have no value, so it's safe to do.
