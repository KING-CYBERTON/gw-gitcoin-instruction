# Mint an SUDT Using the SUDT-CLI Command-Line Tool

[SUDT](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/standards.md#sudt) stands for Simple User Defined Token. This is the Nervos equivalent of an Ethereum [ERC20](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/standards.md#erc20) token.

The [SUDT-CLI](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/tooling.md#sudt-cli) tool allows developers to easily create tokens on Nervos [Layer 1](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/tree/master/src/conceptual-explainers/structure.md#layer-1--layer-2) without any external wallets. Instead, developers must provide a private key. This is convenient during backend development since private keys are often already in use.

## SUDT-CLI Installation

Use the following command to install SUDT-CLI using NPM:

```sh
npm i -g sudt-cli
```

Some types of NPM installations may receive an error when installing. If you receive an error, try this alternate command:

```sh
sudo npm i -g --unsafe-perm sudt-cli
```

After installation, you can check that the tool has been installed correctly by typing `sudt-cli` on the command line. You should see following output:

```sh
➜ sudt-cli

Usage: sudt-cli <command> [options]

Commands:
  sudt-cli issue    Issue new SUDT tokens and send to the specified address.
  sudt-cli balance  Check the SUDT token balance on the specified address.

Options:
      --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -h, --help     Show help                                             [boolean]
```

If you continue to have problems with installation, you can view the alternate installation instructions on the [SUDT-CLI GitHub](https://github.com/jordanmack/sudt-cli).

## Issue SUDT Tokens

In this example we will mint 100 tokens for testing purposes. These tokens will be created on the Nervos Layer 1 Testnet. Use the command below, replacing `<PRIVATE_KEY>` with the private key for a Nervos CKB Layer 1 Testnet account that has been funded with CKBytes.

```sh
sudt-cli issue -k <PRIVATE_KEY> -m 100
```

1. `-k` - The private key of your Nervos CKB Layer 1 Testnet account. If you do not have an account or private key, please view [this tutorial](1.setup.account.in.ckb.cli.md). **Always make sure your private key is prefixed with "0x".**
2. `-m` - The amount of tokens to mint.

Example output:

```txt
➜ sudt-cli issue -k 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -m 1

Note:              It may take 1-2 minutes before the transaction is visible on the Explorer.
```

If everything succeeded it's great - it means you've just successfully minted your first tokens on Nervos!

## Check SUDT Token Balance

After you issue your SUDT tokens, you can check the balance using the following command.

```sh
sudt-cli balance -k <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

1. `-k` - The private key of your Nervos CKB Layer 1 Testnet account. If you do not have an account or private key, please view [this tutorial](1.setup.account.in.ckb.cli.md). **Always make sure your private key is prefixed with "0x".**

Example output:

```txt
➜ sudt-cli balance -k 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18

SUDT Token ID:     0xaaa98d5a0880fac496e42a1ed57b14a2cbd0acd6e57cad451e99c1f391fc62bc
Issuer Lock Hash:  0x5c7253696786b9eddd34e4f6b6e478ec5742bd36569ec60c1d0487480ba4f9e3 (AKA SUDT Type Args)

Balance Address:   ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju
Balance:           100 Tokens
```

As you can see, the SUDT token balance is now 100, which means tokens were correctly minted on the account!

If your goal is to deposit these tokens to Layer 2, then be sure to copy the **Issuer Lock Hash** so you have it ready task 4: [Issue an SUDT Token on Layer 1 and Deposit it to Polyjuice on Layer 2](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/gw-gitcoin-instruction/blob/master/src/tasks/4.issue.sudt.deposit.md).
