# Mint an SUDT Using the SUDT-CLI Command-Line Tool

Firstly - SUDT means **Simple User Defined Token**.

Secondly, `sudt-cli` is a handy tool to create tokens on Nervos Layer 1. It's called **SUDT**-cli because tokens on Nervos Layer 1 follow SUDT standard. You can think of it as the most adopted token standard so far on Nervos Layer 1 - like ERC20 on Ethereum. Actually when you deposit SUDT on Layer 1 to Layer 2 it becomes an ERC20 and vice-versa.

## Install

```sh
npm i -g sudt-cli
```

After installation you can do a quick check if tool has been correctly installed. Run:

```sh
sudt-cli
```

You should see following output:

```sh
➜ sudt-cli

Usage: sudt-cli <command> [options]

Commands:
  sudt-cli issue    Issue new SUDT tokens and send to the specified address.
  sudt-cli balance  Check the SUDT token balance on the specified address.

Options:
      --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -h, --help     Show help                                             [boolean]
```

If you saw above information it means everything works and you can proceed to the next section.

If the command failed you can try fixing your NPM path in your system. It seems like binaries installed via NPM don't show up when your terminal is searching for them.

## Issue

In this example we will mint 100 tokens of out thin air just for testing purposes. They will live on Nervos Layer 1 testnet.

```sh
sudt-cli issue -k 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -m 100
```

Where:
1. `-k` - Private key of your Nervos Layer 1 account, if you don't know how to get it make sure you've created account first. Instructions how to copy private key are in the same tutorial that creating account is.
2. `-m` - Amount of tokens you want to mint.

Example output:

```txt
➜ sudt-cli issue -k 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -m 1
00

Note:              It may take 1-2 minutes before the transaction is visible on the Explorer.
```

If everything succeeded it's great - it means you've just successfully minted your first tokens on Nervos!

## Check balance

After you've issued tokens you can check your balance to double-check tokens were correctly issued. Remember `-k` is your private key.

```sh
sudt-cli balance -k 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18
```

Example output:

```txt
➜ sudt-cli balance -k 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18

Network Type:      testnet
SUDT Token ID:     0xaaa98d5a0880fac496e42a1ed57b14a2cbd0acd6e57cad451e99c1f391fc62bc
Issuer Lock Hash:  0x5c7253696786b9eddd34e4f6b6e478ec5742bd36569ec60c1d0487480ba4f9e3 (AKA SUDT Type Args)
Issuer Address:    ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju
Balance Address:   ckt1qyq9u5vzgtklnqrr6cevra7w2utrsxmjgefs72sfju
Balance:           40 Tokens
```

As you can see the balance is now 100 which means tokens were correctly minted!

If your goal is to deposit these tokens to Layer 2 then copy the **Issuer Lock Hash** and proceed to the [deposit SUDT to Layer 2 tutorial](../tasks/4.issue.sudt.deposit.md)!
