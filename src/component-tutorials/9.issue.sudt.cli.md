# Mint tokens on Layer 1 using SUDT command-line

Firstly - SUDT means **Simple User Defined Token**.

Secondly, `sudt-cli` is a handy tool to create tokens on Nervos Layer 1. It's called **SUDT**-cli because tokens on Nervos Layer 1 follow SUDT standard. You can think of it as the most adopted token standard so far on Nervos Layer 1 - like ERC20 on Ethereum. Actually when you deposit SUDT on Layer 1 to Layer 2 it becomes an ERC20 and vice-versa.

## Install

```
npm i -g sudt-cli
```

After installation you can do a quick check if tool has been correctly installed. Run:
```
sudt-cli
```

You should see following output:
```
âžœ sudt-cli

Usage: sudt-cli <command> [options]

Commands:
  sudt-cli issue    Issue new SUDT tokens and send to the specified address.
  sudt-cli balance  Check the SUDT token balance on the specified address.

Options:
      --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]
  -h, --help     Show help                                             [boolean]
```

If you saw above information it means everything works and you can proceed to the next section.

If the command failed you can try fixing your NPM path in your system. It seems like binaries installed via NPM don't show up when your terminal is searching for them.

## Issue

In this example we will mint 100 tokens of out thin air just for testing purposes. They will live on Nervos Layer 1 testnet.

```
sudt-cli issue -k 0x6cd5e7be2f6504aa5ae7c0c04178d8f47b7cfc63b71d95d9e6282f5b090431bf -m 100
```

Where:
1. `-k` - Private key of your Nervos Layer 1 account, if you don't know how to get it make sure you've created account first. Instructions how to copy private key are in the same tutorial that creating account is.
2. `-m` - Amount of tokens you want to mint.

Example output:
```
sudt-cli issue -k 0x6cd5e7be2f6504aa5ae7c0c04178d8f47b7cfc63b71d95d9e6282f5b090431bf -m 100 -t devnet --defaultLockTxHash 0x2db1b175e0436966e5fc8dd5cdf855970869b37a6c556e00e97ccb161c644eb5

```

If everything succeeded it's great - it means you've just successfully minted your first tokens on Nervos!

## Check balance

After you've issued tokens you can check your balance to double-check tokens were correctly issued. Remember `-k` is your private key.

```
sudt-cli balance -k 0x6cd5e7be2f6504aa5ae7c0c04178d8f47b7cfc63b71d95d9e6282f5b090431bf
```

Example output:

```
Network Type:    testnet
SUDT Token ID:   0x535718478efb3ba6deacf2c1a422295aeb6a72b8f6c766f1d5e35e32247ab693
Issuer Address:  ckt1qyqf22qfzaer95xm5d2m5km0f6k288x9warqnhsf4m
Balance Address: ckt1qyqf22qfzaer95xm5d2m5km0f6k288x9warqnhsf4m
Balance:         100
SUDT Type Args:  0x6f33df7e3fffb47794f9ca37643118ba79207ac92596a0555e9038828e547357
```

As you can see the balance is now 100 which means tokens were correctly minted!

If your goal is to deposit these tokens to Layer 2 then remember to copy **SUDT Type Args** and proceed to the [deposit SUDT to Layer 2 tutorial!](../challenges/4.issue.sudt.deposit.md)
