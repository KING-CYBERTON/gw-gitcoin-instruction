# Create a Godwoken Account by Making a Layer 2 Deposit

Before a user can start using Godwoken, they first need to create an account. Creating an account on Layer 2 begins with the first logical step, depositing funds from Layer 1 to Layer 2. This single action creates the account and funds it so it is ready to be used.

## 1. Setup the Godwoken Examples Tools Package

In order to interact with Nervos' Layer 2 Testnet, we need to clone the Godwoken Examples tool repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/godwoken-examples -b interopability
```

The command above clones the repository and checks out the `interopability` branch which we will be using.

The next step is to configure the tool so it can properly interact with the Testnet. These commands will initialize the tool, then locate the addresses of the Layer 2 resources that are required by the tool and save them to a configuration file.

```sh
cd godwoken-examples
yarn && yarn run build-all
yarn run generate-testnet-configs
```

Your tools should now be ready to start interacting with Nervos Layer 2!

## 2. Make a Deposit to Layer 2

The next step is to deposit some CKBytes from Layer 1 to Layer 2. To do this we need the private key of your Layer 1 account, and we also need to know what your Ethereum address is so we can depost to it on Layer 2.

First, we need to find the private key that was generated for your Layer 1 account. It should look something like this:

```txt
0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18
```

Note: The above line is our demonstration private key. You need to use the private key you generated earlier.

Next, we need to locate your Ethereum address. You can find this by opening MetaMask and clicking on the address field to copy it.

Then we use the `account-cli` tool to make the deposit by providing your private key, and the Ethereum address you are depositing to:

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -c 40000000000 -p <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> -l <YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS>
```

- Replace `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with the private key to your account. Make sure your account has been funded with Testnet CKBytes from the [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.nervos.org/).
- Replace `<YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS>` with the Ethereum address of your MetaMask account that you will use with Layer 2.
- The `-c VALUE` parameter is the amount of CKBytes to transfer, written in Shannons. A Shannon is a unit of measurement in Nervos, that is the equivalent of a Satoshi in Bitcoin. There are 100,000,000 Shannons in a CKByte. In our example, we are depositing 400 CKBytes, because this is the minimum number required by Godwoken. This must be expressed in Shannons. ie: 400 * 100,000,000 = 40,000,000,000

Example command and output:

```txt
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -c 40000000000 -l 0xD173313A51f8fc37BcF67569b463abd89d81844f -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -cc 0xf8a4586790460d7cd8eb389af4cd1b0cfc9903b5d4b88b9eedb8fb9c150c4c88
