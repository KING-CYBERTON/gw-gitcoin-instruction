# Create a Godwoken Account by Making a Layer 2 Deposit

Before a user can start using Godwoken, they first need to create an account. Creating an account on Layer 2 begins with the first logical step, depositing funds from Layer 1 to Layer 2. This single action creates the account and funds it so it is ready to be used.

## 1. [Setup the Godwoken Examples Tools Package](../component-tutorials/12.setup.and.use.account.cli.md)

## 2. Make a Deposit to Layer 2

The next step is to deposit some CKBytes from Layer 1 to Layer 2. To do this we need the private key of your Layer 1 account, and we also need to know what your Ethereum address is so we can depost to it on Layer 2.

First, we need to find the private key that was generated for your Layer 1 account. It should look something like this:

```txt
0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18
```

Note: The above line is our demonstration private key. You need to use the private key you generated earlier.

Next, we need to locate your Ethereum address. You can find this by opening MetaMask and clicking on the address field to copy it.

Then we use the `account-cli` tool to make the deposit by providing your private key, and the Ethereum address you are depositing to:

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -r <INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL> -p <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> -l <YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS> -c <SHANNONS_AMOUNT>
```

1. `<INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL>` - The RPC URL of the Testnet CKB node you will use. You can [setup your own local Testnet node](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/testnet), or you can use any public node.\
Nervos Foundation Public Testnet CKB Node: `http://3.235.223.161:18114`
2. `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` The private key to your Nervos Layer 1 account. Make sure your account has been funded with Testnet CKBytes from the [Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.nervos.org/).
3. `<YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS>` - The Ethereum address of your account from MetaMask. This will be used to receive funds on Layer 2. This can be found in MetaMask by clicking the address within the wallet as seen in [step 2](#2-make-a-deposit-to-layer-2) of this tutorial.
4. `<SHANNONS_AMOUNT>` - The amount of CKBytes to transfer, written in Shannons. A Shannon is a unit of measurement in Nervos that is the equivalent of a Satoshi in Bitcoin. We recommend depositing 400 CKBytes, which is the minimum number required by Godwoken. There are 100,000,000 Shannons in a CKByte, and this value must be expressed in Shannons. ie: 400 * 100,000,000 = 40,000,000,000

Example final command with all variables filled in:

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -r http://3.235.223.161:18114 -l 0xD173313A51f8fc37BcF67569b463abd89d81844f -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -c 40000000000
```
