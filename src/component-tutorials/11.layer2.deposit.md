# Run Layer 2 deposit command-line application with the private key from your account

## 1. Prepare tool to create Layer 2 account

First you need to download a tool that allows for interacting with Nervos Layer 2. Clone this open-source repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/godwoken-examples 
git checkout interopability
```

After you've executed those two commands above you should be ready to prepare a configuration for interacting with testnet. The tool needs to have addresses of all the Layer 2 infrastructure and that's why we need to generate it.

The first command builds the tool and the second makes it ready for interacting with the testnet.

```
yarn && yarn run build-all
yarn run generate-testnet-configs
```

You should be ready to start interacting with Nervos Layer 2!

## 2. Deposit some CKB to create a Layer 2 account

In this step you will create an account on Nervos Layer 2. This account will give you a way to interact with the vast ecosystem of the Ethereum projects in Nervos ecosystem.

To tap into this world run following command:

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -c 40000000000 -p <private_key> -l <your_eth_address>
```

- Replace `<private_key>` with the private key to your account. Make sure your account has funds from the testnet faucet.
- Replace `<your_eth_address>` with the address of the account from MetaMask that you want to receive funds on Layer 2
- `-c VALUE` the value of `-c` parameter is the amount of CKB to transfer - in this example it's 400 CKB (400 * 10 to the power of 8 *[8 is the number of decimals in CKB asset]*)

Example command and output:
```
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit -c 40000000000 -l 0xD173313A51f8fc37BcF67569b463abd89d81844f -p 0x79682c20bbcaf7fcf18eb0c69b133c872227ceb88971090e7f2242c80cd54d18 -cc 0xf8a4586790460d7cd8eb389af4cd1b0cfc9903b5d4b88b9eedb8fb9c150c4c88
