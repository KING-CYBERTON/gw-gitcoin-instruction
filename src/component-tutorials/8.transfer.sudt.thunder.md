# Transfer SUDT Using Thunder Issue SUDT

Before you begin make sure you've already issued your SUDT Token. If you don't know how to do that please check [Issue SUDT using Thunder Issue dapp](src/component-tutorials/2.issue.sudt.thunder.md) Component Tutorial.

Make sure also Keypering wallet is running. Otherwise Thunder Issue dapp won't work.

Go to https://udt.ckbapp.dev/transfer. In the "Receiver Address" field paste the receiving address and set "Transfer Token Count" to the amount that you wish to send.

## Sending to Asset Account (Anyone-Can-Pay)

*If you don't know how to create an Asset Account or install Neuron wallet check [Receive SUDT in Neuron wallet](src/component-tutorials/7.receive.sudt.in.neuron.md) Component Tutorial.*

If you're sending to Neuron Wallet Asset Account (Anyone-Can-Pay type of account) make sure that checkbox "I will provide some extra CKB capacity for the receiver" is **unchecked** because the receiving person already created a place for the token to be received.

When the address and the amount is filled press Submit button.

After pressing the button you should see a confirmation dialog in Keypering wallet. Press "Approve" to transfer SUDT.

Then wait a little bit on the Thunder Issue website for your transaction to confirm. It will be first in the Pending state.
