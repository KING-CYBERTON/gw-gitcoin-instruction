# Setup and Use the `account-cli` Tool

When working with Nervos' Layer 2 Testnet, there are some tools available that can greatly speed up the development process, and make life easier. One such tool is `account-cli`. This tool can be used to perform many common Layer 2 actions, such as depositing assets from Layer 1 to Layer 2.

## Setup the Godwoken Examples Tools Package

The `account-cli` tool is part of the Godwoken Examples tool package that is available on GitHub. The first step is to clone the `testnet-script` branch of this repo, which has been specifically tailored for use with the Gitcoin tasks.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/projects
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/godwoken-examples -b testnet-script
```

The command above clones the repository and checks out the `testnet-script` branch which you will be using.

The next step is to configure the tool so it can properly interact with the Testnet. These commands will initialize the tool, then locate the addresses of the Layer 2 resources that are required by the tool and save them to a configuration file.

```sh
cd ~/projects/godwoken-examples
yarn && yarn build-all
yarn generate-testnet-configs
```

Your tools should now be ready to start interacting with Nervos Layer 2!

> Note: The 'account-cli' tool will need to sync with Testnet on the first usage. This can sometimes take several hours, but there are ways to speed this up. **Look at the instructions below** to speed it up using snapshot data.

## Speeding Up `account-cli` Synchronization by Using Snapshot Data

The `account-cli` tool uses a built in CKB Indexer, which needs to fully synchronize with a Testnet CKB Node before it can create transactions. This process can be sped up dramatically by using snapshot data.

A snapshot is a compressed archive of blockchain data that can be downloaded from a website and extracted into your project directory. Using a snapshot to bootstrap your project can save a lot of time compared to the normal process of downloading and verifying each block, but this speed up comes at the expense of security. Relying on a snapshot is insecure, and therefore this should never be done on the Mainnet. However, it is acceptable for the Testnet since none of the tokens or assets have any value.

To use a snapshot, stop the `account-cli` tool if it is running by pressing `ctrl+c`, then run the following steps below to download the snapshot data to the appropriate location.

### 1. Install the 7zip Compression Tool

Snapshot data is compressed into 7zip archives, and you will need a 7zip tool to extract the data before it can be used. On Linux, `p7zip` can be used.

```sh
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
```

### 2. Clone the Godwoken Examples Tools Package

You should already have the repo checked out from the steps above, but if you don't, you will need it before continuing.

```sh
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/Kuzirashi/godwoken-examples -b testnet-script
```

### 3. Use the Snapshot Download Script

This script will download a recent snapshot and expand it to a directory named `indexed-data` so it can be used by `account-cli`.

```sh
cd ~/projects/godwoken-examples
chmod +x get-testnet-snapshot-data.sh
./get-testnet-snapshot-data.sh
```

After this process is successful, start the `account-cli` tool again using the same command that was used previously. The sync process should now start much higher (usually 90% or more), and the remaining sync will take much less time.

## Polyjuice Address Conversion

A Polyjuice address is the address that Nervos' Layer 2 uses internally to track the Ethereum address behind it. The concept of Polyjuice address exists because of the cross-chain Layer 2 architecture used by Nervos. It is not possible to use the Ethereum address on Nervos Layer 2 because Nervos Layer 2 is designed to also support many other type of blockchain accounts. The addresses from all these different blockchains must be standardized to a single format that Nervos can utilize internally.

Different tools will require different address formats. This is how you convert between the two.

### Convert An Ethereum Address to a Polyjuice Address

You can use the `to-short-address` command from `account-cli` to convert from an Ethereum address to a Polyjuice address.

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js to-short-address -a <YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>
```

Replace `<YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>` with Ethereum address to convert.

As a result of running this command you will receive corresponding Polyjuice address.

Example Output:

```txt
➜ node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js to-short-address -a 0xda25163ac482dbae64bc6e421fbf51624b318308
godwoken short address: 0x55a55ca0f9bef2754acf5ea0e46cbae4c17d2bd7
```

### Convert a Polyjuice Address to an Ethereum Address

You can use the `to-eth-address` command from `account-cli` to convert from a Polyjuice address to an Ethereum address.

> Note: This command will not work until after a Godwoken account has been created on Layer 2 for the corresponding Ethereum address.

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js to-eth-address -a <YOUR_POLYJUICE_ADDRESS>
```

Replace `<YOUR_POLYJUICE_ADDRESS>` with Polyjuice address to convert.

As a result of running this command you will receive corresponding Ethereum address.

Example Output:

```txt
➜ node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js to-eth-address -a 0x55a55ca0f9bef2754acf5ea0e46cbae4c17d2bd7
eth eoa address: 0xda25163ac482dbae64bc6e421fbf51624b318308
```
