# Setup and sync CKB testnet node, indexer and install ckb-cli

## Run test node

follow this [instruction](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/testnet) to run a ckb testnet node

### Linux

```
cd ~
mkdir projects
cd projects
curl -O https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases/download/v0.42.0/ckb_v0.42.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz -L
tar -xvzf ckb_v0.42.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
mv ckb_v0.42.0_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz ckb-0.42
```

Now, add CKB binary to path. If you use bash:

```
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Or if you use Zsh:
```
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Then after you've opened proper file - add the following line at the end of it (note that I've put `ckb-0.42` directory in the `~/projects` folder, adjust it for your setup):

```
export PATH=$HOME/projects/ckb-0.42:$PATH
```

Now restart terminal session and run:

```
ckb
```

It should print help information for CKB binary. If it doesn't work and system can't find the `ckb` command something is misconfigured. [Working example command output](https://gist.github.com/Kuzirashi/ef4b8f164e086913872be4e9e5d727a6).

```sh
ckb init --chain testnet
ckb run
```
