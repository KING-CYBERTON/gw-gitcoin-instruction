# Receive SUDT in Neuron wallet

On Nervos you can hold both Nervos native currency - CKB, but also all kinds of tokens. In this tutorial you will learn how to receive SUDT in Neuron wallet. 

## Before you begin

Before proceeding further make sure you:
1. have a Token ID, Name, Symbol, and Number of Decimals prepared

SUDT standard Token ID is the "args" value of "Type Script" in of the SUDT "Cell". Please don't worry if you don't understand what are "args", "Type Script" or "Cell" at this moment. Someone should give you this Token ID before creating you receiving SUDT. In any case, here's Token ID seen in Nervos explorer:

## Setup

You can start by downloading and installing Neuron wallet from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/neuron/releases). Download .exe if you're using Windows, .dmg if you're on MacOS and .AppImage if you're on Linux.

Switch the network to testnet. Go to Help > Settings > Networks. Click "Add Network".

Fill "RPC URL" and "Name". "RPC URL" should be address of Nervos testnet node. It could be local or remote node. "Name" can be anything. You can use "Testnet Remote" for example.

When you've filled both values press "Save".

After network is added you can close "Settings" and you will see that Neuron will start syncing with new network.

Wait for Neuron wallet to sync with testnet. This can take few hours. You can follow the progress in bottom-left part of the wallet.

## Using checkpoint data for syncing

If you wish to download blockchain data, which could be much faster than waiting for Neuron to sync please follow below instructions.

Before doing anything make close Neuron wallet.

After that you need to download [indexer-data.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q0l9SDXb39cRWuUWFNwWqJpzlqvI3L9/view?usp=sharing) file which contains data can be plugged into Neuron to make syncing dramatically faster.

### Windows

Go to your `AppData\Roaming\Neuron\indexer_data` directory, eg. `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Neuron\indexer_data`. Replace `0x10639e0895502b5688a6be8cf69460d76541bfa4821629d86d62ba0aae3f9606` directory content with the content of downloaded file.

This is how your `indexer_data\0x10639e0895502b5688a6be8cf69460d76541bfa4821629d86d62ba0aae3f9606` should look like after filling directory data:

After this step you can see that your wallet will almost complete syncing (from 0% to 90%+):

You still need to wait a bit though for remaining data to be download, but now it's a lot less than it was before downloading data.

## Receive funds

Before you can receive SUDT you need to have some Nervos native currency (CKB) in your account. This is because you need to create special type of address to receive a token.

When your wallet is setup make sure you have some CKB in your wallet. You can copy your address from "Receive" section and use it in testnet faucet.

Now you can go to the testnet faucet - https://faucet.nervos.org/ - where you can get some funds

### Faucet

Paste your wallet address into big "Enter your Aggron wallet address" input box. The address is the one that you copied from the wallet earlier.

When the input box is filled click "Claim" button. Your transaction will become pending and you should receive funds shortly. It usually takes up to few minutes. After this transaction completes you will be ready to go.

Transaction is first in pending state:

Then it completes:

As you've seen above you can follow receiving funds progress on the website.

When the transaction is finally done you should see an increased balance in your wallet. These are your testnet funds ready to use.

## Create Asset Account

Asset Account is a special type of account for receiving tokens in Nervos. It differs from the normal account in the security mechanism used. Asset Account is using Anyone-Can-Pay security lock. The benefit of that is anyone can send you tokens cheap. We won't go into details on this topic, but you can think of Asset Account as the most optimal type of account for receiving tokens.

We will start by going to "Asset Accounts" section in Neuron wallet. Then, click "Plus" button in top-right section of the UI to add a new Asset Account.

<img src="../images/neuron-asset-accounts-empty.png" width="100%" />

Pick a name for your account. This could be anything you wish. In terms of the type of the account leave "sUDT Account" selected.

<img src="../images/neuron-asset-account-name.png" height="200" />

In the next step fill in the token details of the token you wish to create receiving account for. You should have the details of the token that you wish to receive from the person that is going to send you tokens. If you don't have those details please see "Before you begin" section at the beginning of this tutorial.

After you've filled all the details press Confirm button. You will also have to enter password to your account to send transaction which will create Asset Account.

<img src="../images/neuron-set-token-info.png" height="300" />

After confirming and sending transaction it will land in the "History" tab of your wallet in "Pending" state.

<img src="../images/neuron-create-asset-account-pending.png" height="300px" />

You need to wait some time, could be something like 5 minutes for your transaction to enter "Confirming" state and the icon to turn green. As soon as it enters this state you can proceed to the next step.

## Receive SUDT

Go to Asset Accounts tab, hover over your newly created Asset Account and you will see "Receive" button. Click it.

<img src="../images/neuron-asset-receive.png" height="300" />

You will see an address to receive SUDT tokens. Copy it.

<img src="../images/neuron-asset-receive-address.png" height="300" />

The address that you copied is the address that you need to give to someone to send you SUDT tokens. Please note that only the type of the token that you specified when creating the account can be received.

This is basically all you need to do to receive SUDT from someone!

## Not sure how to send SUDT?

One of the ways how you can send SUDT to your Neuron Asset Account is to transfer it using Thunder Issue dapp. If you want to learn how to do that check [Transfer SUDT using "Thunder Issue SUDT" dapp](./8.transfer.sudt.thunder.md).

After someone sending you SUDT you will see your Asset Account balance increased.
