# 4. Issue a layer 1 SUDT token, then deposit it into Polyjuice

This challenge revolves around issuing a token on Nervos layer 1 and then moving it into layer 2 with EVM support. Token on layer 1 complies with SUDT standard, which is one of the simplest forms of asset on Nervos. When you move such token to layer 2 it will become an ERC20 token, which is the most popular standard on Ethereum Virtual Machine blockchains.

The motivation for moving tokens to layer 2 is enabling EVM support for your token - being able to use your token with smart-contracts and apps that already work on Ethereum Virtual Machine, but also scaling your application - meaning your application can process more transactions in the same time.

Imagine all the possibilities moving tokens from other blockchains such as Ethereum, Cardano and Tron to Nervos and then depositing them to layer 2 and interacting with them can enable. One of more obvious use cases for that would be exchanging them using a decentralized exchange.

**Requirements**

Before your start make sure you've correctly setup your developer environment. For information about system requirements and challenge setup please [check this article](/src/challenge-setup-and-requirements/challenge-setup-and-requirements.md).

**Introduction**

Below you will find various Nervos ecosystem Component Tutorials mixed with Challenge Instructions where you need a glue to connect two Component Tutorials together. These instructions executed in the order specified below will guide you to completing this challenge.

## Challenge Instructions

We will start with setting up a Nervos layer 1 wallet - which is a place where your layer 1 assets live. The wallet that we will use also can connect to various web applications. The application we will use called Thunder Issue dapp will talk to your wallet asking you to send transactions. You will have to accept this transaction to issue a token.

### [1. Setup Keypering with funds on testnet](/src/component-tutorials/1.setup.keypering.with.funds.md)

After wallet is setup with funds on the testnet network we can use it with Thunder Issue dapp to actually issue a token on Nervos layer one!
### [2. Issue SUDT using Thunder Issue dapp](/src/component-tutorials/2.issue.sudt.thunder.md)

## 3. Prepare a tool to deposit SUDT into Layer 2

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/Godwoken-examples
git checkout tags/v0.2.1
yarn && yarn run build-all
yarn run generate-testnet-configs
```

## 4. Connect to testnet node

Follow this [instruction](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/guides/testnet) to run a CKB testnet node or connect to existing testnet node.

1. Go to `godwoken-examples/packages/tools/configs/godwoken-config.json`
2. Change `rpc_client.ckb_url` value to `INSERT_TESTNET_RPC_URL`
3. Change `rpc_client.indexer_url` value to `INSERT_TESTNET_INDEXER_URL`

Alternatively you can start a testnet node if you don't want to use existing node:
```sh
ckb init --chain testnet
ckb run
```

## 5. Deposit some SUDT (below is 400 SUDT) to create a Layer 2 account on Godwoken

To deposit SUDT into Layer 2 execute following command in Godwoken-examples directory, but first replace 3 variables with the values matching your wallet information.

```sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit-sudt -m 400 -s LOCK_SCRIPT_HASH -p PRIVATE_KEY -l ETH_ADDRESS
```

Variables:
1. LOCK_SCRIPT_HASH
2. PRIVATE_KEY
3. ETH_ADDRESS

**LOCK_SCRIPT_HASH**

1. Go to http://ckb.tools/address
2. In "Nervos CKB Address" enter your address from Keypering wallet.
3. To get lock hash copy "Lock Script Hash" value.

**PRIVATE_KEY**

You must use the same `PRIVATE_KEY` to issue SUDT and to deposit SUDT on Godwoken account.

[Extract private key from Keypering wallet](/src/component-tutorials/6.keypering.extract.private.key.md).

**ETH_ADDRESS**

Create account in MetaMask and copy its address.

---

Example final command:

``` sh
node ./packages/tools/lib/account-cli.js deposit-sudt -m 400 -s 0x7e5da54419e27fc6d36194633ebc2209dd5cc30e3a98169c4a40958a52f19832 -p c8d3d048ca33c901860684887c54400c220bbdbe25243f98f0af2dfa33a098a8ff459fca785c0bbf08b0c9b5902eb270bdc1aca5f2d6b39db18913e12b8af46c -l 0xCfFD8D52965D59508de83333fC5A310438f76FF1
```

You have to wait for Lumos indexer to sync with testet first. It might take a lot of time (up to few hours). Please be patient.
