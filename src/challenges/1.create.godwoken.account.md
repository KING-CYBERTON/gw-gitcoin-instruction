# 1. Create a Godwoken account on testnet

In the first challenge you'll create an account on Nervos EVM Layer 2. EVM means it is Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible, so you can run Ethereum smart-contracts there and use MetaMask to interact with the application.

Layer 2 means it lives in addition to the core blockchain - Layer 1. Layer 1 is way different from Layer 2: for example uses Rust instead of Solidity for smart-contracts.

You don't need to worry too much about Layer 1 in these challenges though. Alright, lets start creating an account!

The high-level overview of the process is:
1. [Create an account on layer 1, get free funds from testnet faucet and export the private key](../component-tutorials/10.setup.account.cli.md)
2. [Run Layer 2 deposit command-line application with the private key from your account](../component-tutorials/11.layer2.deposit.md)
